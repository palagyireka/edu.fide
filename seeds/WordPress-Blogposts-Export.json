Recently, the <a href=\"https:\/\/fide.us3.list-manage.com\/track\/click?u=6d944e993248d15fc2b046696&amp;id=1105ba3d7d&amp;e=9179e1650a\"><strong>Israel Chess Federation<\/strong><\/a> and the Ministry of Education in Israel have announced the expansion of the program \"Chess for Every Child\", which consists of six special projects aimed at enabling second and third-grade children all over Israel to learn the game of chess during 2021.\r\n\r\nThe program will be funded by <strong>Mifal Hapais<\/strong>, the Israeli lottery organization, which is a \u201ccommunity interest company\u201d whose core purpose is to raise funds from the public through lotteries, for investments in the community and Israel society as a whole. All of Mifal Hapais's profits are invested in the community through innumerable social projects in education, welfare, community volunteerism, and the promotion of Israeli culture.\r\n\r\n\u201cChess is recognized by the public, heads of government, and senior government officials in Israel as an effective means of improving attention and concentration, developing strategic thinking, competitiveness and the value of victory among youth\u201d, explains the Israel Chess Federation. \u201cMifal Hapais is investing many resources in this project because it realizes that chess is an excellent tool for developing thinking and improving capabilities among children, among them, patience, success, coping with failure, strategic thinking, the ability to solve problems requiring concentration, creativity, etc.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis program was funded with approximately \u20ac408,000 (NIS 1.6 million) in the 2019-2020 school year. Citing the growing interest of authorities and schools in Israel in the project, <strong>Dr. Zvika Barkai<\/strong>, Chairman of the Israel Chess Federation, made a petition to increase this budget. The proposal was accepted by the chairman of Mifal Hapais, <strong>Mr. Avigdor Yitzhaki<\/strong>, who decided to increase the budget to <strong>\u20ac918,000<\/strong> (NIS 3.6 million) for the 2020-2021 school year. Given the fact that 2020 was a challenging year in the financing of non-healthcare projects, this is a substantial increase.\r\n\r\nThe program was launched during the 2018-2019 school year, 40 second-grade classes from all the eight primary schools in Kiryat Yam participated in the chess lessons. The number was increased to 205 classes the following school year, 2019-2020, when the project grew and expanded to the third grades as well. In view of the positive results and the enthusiasm of the students, numerous local authorities and school principals praised the project and requested additional hours and lessons. In some cases, they continued the chess lessons at their own expense.\r\n\r\nThe increased budget will allow the Israel Chess Federation to expand the program to a total of 410 classes, a 100% increase. Mifal Hapais will oversee the implementation of the program, taking the demand into account and giving priority to minority groups and socioeconomically disadvantaged sectors.\r\n\r\nMore information: <a href=\"https:\/\/fide.us3.list-manage.com\/track\/click?u=6d944e993248d15fc2b046696&amp;id=0ce860df4f&amp;e=9179e1650a\">www.chess.org.il<\/a>","Excerpt":"","Date":"2021-03-31 15:52:04","Post Type":"post","Permalink":"https:\/\/edu.fide.com\/israel-chess-for-every-child\/"},{"ID":"929","Title":"Pilot Preparation of Teachers - School Instructor Seminar Online 16-18 April","Content":"This course pilots the latest upgrade to the School Instructor seminar and will be attended by almost 30 participants from all over the world.

Furthermore, online chess enthusiasts can log in to a plethora of interactive digital activities.<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\nFor the third year, the main sponsor of the event is Morgan Stanley, bringing coding classes for children, chess challenges against the players working at the company and the Morgan Stanley Chess Caf\u00e9 to the festival.\r\n\r\nThe main focuses of this year\u2019s festival are creativity and innovation, promoted by revolutionary minds who dare to break conventions and give novel answers to challenges of their fields. Noam Manella - author of the book \u201cThink Like a Machine\u201d, will discuss how we can invoke the creativity within ourselves; Indian engineer Ashwin Subramanian will give us an sneak peek into a brand new experiment he\u2019s been conducting: using biofeedback data, he is trying to determine how and what the chess player\u2019s body responds to during the game, and how it can be utilized during preparation. Where the festival inspires the mind, soothes the spirit, through the unparalleled musical performance of Juga Di Prima, presenting piano performances paying homage to gender equality in chess.\r\n\r\nAccording to Judit Polgar, founder of the Global Chess Festival, \u201cChess is a language that knows no borders, no age, no nationality - a common language that we all speak, a language that everyone can make his own at the Global Chess Festival. Nothing proves that better than the movement it invoked: chess enthusiasts, speakers, artists, scientists joined from all over the globe. Hence our timeless motto: chess connects us! The focus of 2021\u2019s Global Chess Festival couldn\u2019t be more pressing, as the last year all of our lives have been about pathfinding, innovation and introspection. This year we decided to expand the festival to the digital world, so more of us can be together than ever before.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMastering digital competences and the capability to innovate are requirements that profoundly determine the success of corporations and experts. This also applies to schoolchildren: learning basic informatics, programming languages - the foundations of today\u2019s digital solutions - can be supported with the logics of chess. Morgan Stanley is determined to support students in their endeavours to learn science, technology, engineering and mathematics - better known as STEM - as early as possible; enabling them to flexibly respond to the changes of the workforce market, and to become innovators of the future.\u201d - said Norbert Fogarasi, Managing Director of Morgan Stanley Budapest, active chess player and member of the Hungarian Chess Federation.\r\n\r\nEducation is an inherent part of the DNA of the Global Chess Festival, climaxing in the Educational Chess Summit conference, where contemporary thinkers share their take on the connection between chess and education. The Festival is also home to the Judit Polgar Method which is a practical approach to the application of chess in education; it\u2019s newest element - Chess PE - will make its debut at the Global Chess Festival.\r\n\r\nChildren and parents visiting the Hungarian National Gallery will witness how a chessboard can enhance the kids\u2019 orientational abilities, and try it out in practice.\r\n\r\nThis year's Global Chess Festival will be more interactive than ever: the usual simultaneous chess exhibitons will be complemented by exciting online games, first of which is the ChessConnectsUs challenge: every single day two new players join the online game, make their moves and then pass on the helm to two newcomers.

Few of them had programs that focus on using chess to develop \u201cemotional intelligence\u201d and what others call \u201csoft\u201d skills. In this VI Congress titled: \u201cValues and Emotions on Chess in Education,'' organized recently by AjEdu-DIM, all of the projects focused mainly on developing students' socio-emotional skills using chess as their main tool.\r\n\r\nThe principal goal of the VI Congress was to provide innovative methodologies and resources to promote values and educate emotions through educational chess, using gamification and transversality. Within the two years of the pandemic, students around the world are suffering even more in their socio-emotional area. The projects presented give another tool to educators, counselors, and psychologists to increase students\u2019 social emotional skills with regard to values and self-regulation of their emotions by using the game of chess as their tool.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect that was very beneficial about this Virtual Congress was the format. Presenters that were interested in participating needed to send their work with specific requirements to the AjEdu Committee for their selection. Nineteen speakers from many countries were selected, and their presentations were published on the AjEdu-DIM web for everybody to review. Anybody could go back to the actual source and review all of the contents of each presentation.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/dimglobal.ning.com\/groups\/group\/forum?groupUrl=i-congreso-virtual-ajedu&amp;id=1652370:Group:54414&amp;page=2\">Foro de discusi\u00f3n - DIM-EDU (ning.com)<\/a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe benefits of such a format are tremendous. If you are an educator and in the classroom, it is very difficult to ask for time off to attend a Congress, but with this format you could review each presentation at your own pace. Also in that way, with some adaptation to our school environment, each of us may use some of the activities presented with our own students in the classroom.\r\n\r\nFinally, it was very emotional to attend and listen to all the wonderful presentations at the Congress. It was very gratifying to participate along with many other speakers and highly elevate the importance of using chess in schools to develop life skills. As many of you may know, I have advocated intensively since the publication of my book in 2001, \u201c<em>Teaching Life Skills through Chess<\/em>,\u201d in favor of the promotion of teaching social emotional skills with chess.\u00a0 Recently the publication by Karel van Delft of the Book, \u201cChess For Educators\u201d (2021), described extensively as well my work in chapter 7.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOn December 30th, the second part of the Congress continued with a live virtual broadcast on YouTube where each speaker presented and answered questions about their project. During the live broadcast, songs about chess interpreted by Alejandro Oliva, such as \u201c<em>Tocada Movida<\/em>,\u201d were interpreted to make the transition to each speaker smoothly.\r\n\r\nThe international speakers were distributed in six tables of debate during three different Sundays. Each table was named using one of the feelings (joy, confidence, surprise, perseverance, empathy, and anger). You can watch their presentations at the following link (as a reminder the presentations were done in Spanish).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>First Day: December 30th<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/8spOYl9QxPQ\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/8spOYl9QxPQ<\/a>\r\n\r\nTable 1 - <strong>Joy<\/strong>: Jordi Pri\u00f3, Joaqu\u00edn Fern\u00e1ndez, Miriam Monreal, Lourdes Giraldo\r\n\r\nTable 2 - <strong>Confidence<\/strong>: Xavier Garcia, Edgar Gim\u00e9nez, Mar\u00eda Mu\u00f1oz\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Second Day: February 6th<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/_qE0xIrKslM\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/_qE0xIrKslM<\/a>\r\n\r\nTable 3 - <strong>Surprise<\/strong>: Ana Mar\u00eda Fuentes, Antonio Bertomeu, Fernando Moreno\r\n\r\nTable 4 - <strong>Perseverance<\/strong>: Pedro M.

This topic included: recognizing basic vital needs and assessing, weighing and balancing our emotional strengths and weaknesses. Some specific objectives included distinguishing \u201cwhat I like\u201d from \u201cwhat suits me,\u201d recognizing and rationalizing both our losses and our gains, reflecting on the changes that occur throughout our lives in regard to our emotional strengths and weaknesses, and reflecting about the invariability of our basic vital needs, as well as death as the culmination of our vital process.\r\n\r\nReflecting on our weaknesses, weighing them, and assigning a name to each chess piece according to the value and the importance that we give them in our lives with regard to our fears, concerns, people, situations, etc., are some of the valuable tools explored during this presentation.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>\"Together, we play better\u201d <\/strong>\"Juntos, jugamos mejor\u201d<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nLorena Garc\u00eda Afonso\r\n\r\nDesde Tacoronte, Tenerife .\r\n\r\nFrom Tacoronte, Tenerife.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nChess becomes a very effective educational tool to work on Emotional Intelligence and social skills. We create spaces to share and to play with others. Those scenarios are full of learning and personal growth. We all have something to teach and a lot to learn. Chess invites us to have our pieces work as a team and in harmony, something that we can transfer to our group, family, and society. Like the chess pieces, we are unique and special beings that enrich ourselves by working as a team.

The participants particularly appreciated the quality of the teaching materials, the facilitation of the training by the speakers which generally met their initial expectations and made them want to develop a project.\r\n\r\nHere is some inspirational feedback from the participants:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe training went well.

Let us begin with a brief introduction about the author, in her own words:\r\n\r\nI worked as an educational consultant for the gifted and talented at Region IX Educational Service Center. I became increasingly interested in critical and creative thinking and cognitive processing during this time. I left that job to dedicate myself full-time to my doctoral studies in learning and instruction, exploring how people encode information and how these differences affect their problem-solving ability. After completing my doctorate, I received a post-doc at Yale University working with Robert Sternberg in applying different theoretical learning models to classroom instruction. After my post-doc, I returned to San Francisco and worked as a research analyst. In addition, I taught college courses in research methodology and education.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, I discovered chess. I became fascinated with tactics problems and joined the Mechanics Institute chess club, only to discover increasingly complex patterns and ideas. I started to enjoy studying chess as much as playing it, maybe even more. It provided a venue to explore the game and the cognitive processes underlying problem-solving. My interest merged, and I emersed myself in teaching myself chess\u2014asking questions and finding answers\u2014only to discover new questions. Chess became both my playground and my laboratory.\r\n\r\nOver the last ten years, I have learned much about chess, cognitive processing, learning, and teaching. In this series of blogs, I want to share some of the key insights I gained; please join me on the journey.\r\n\r\nRenate Otterbach\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","Excerpt":"","Date":"2023-01-10 11:36:41","Post Type":"post","Permalink":"https:\/\/edu.fide.com\/develop-learning-to-learn-strategies-through-chess\/"},{"ID":"2532","Title":"How Can We Maximize Chess Learning?","Content":"<strong><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2534\" src=\"https:\/\/edu.fide.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/38805398472_d18f765171_o-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1594\" \/>Overview <\/strong>\r\n\r\nHow do we maximize learning? What is the most effective way of teaching or coaching? Does the effectiveness of teaching strategies differ among students? If so, how do we know what technique to use for whom? How effective are we in teaching different types of students?\r\n\r\nIn this series of blogs, we'll explore these questions from multiple perspectives and conceptual frameworks derived from cognition, learning theory, and pedagogy research.\r\n\r\n<strong>Background <\/strong>\r\n\r\nAs there are multiple frameworks and paradigms for teaching and learning, starting with a common framework will be helpful. So, let's begin by defining learning.\r\n\r\nLearning can be defined as the process by which the learner takes in information and transforms it into concepts. These concepts can be rearranged differently and applied to specific situations and problems.\r\n\r\n<strong>In this context, how do we define coaching\/teaching?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nTeaching can be defined as helping the student to bridge the gap between the current understanding and the desired outcome. In chess, in difference to many other subject areas, the outcome is clearly defined as winning the game. Yet, given chess's complexity, this is a multilayered challenge. First, chess requires multi-level encoding; second, different students have different strengths and weaknesses that result in different learning patterns and require different teaching strategies.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Personal learning experience<\/strong>\r\n\r\nI started my chess study somewhere between the age of 54 and 56. Before this, I had learned the basic chess moves and played less than a handful of chess games. Coming from an academic background, learning from books was natural, and I threw myself wholeheartedly into my chess studies. Understanding the fundamental concepts was relatively easy, but applying them over the Board presented a unique challenge.\r\n\r\nI remember my struggle as a beginning chess player trying to apply the concept of development to my games. Generally, I did an excellent job of getting my pieces to good squares in the opening. I had not studied opening theory, as I there seems to be a general believe that beginners should not concentrate on opening theory. So, in the openings phase I had to figure things out for myself. Then, I discovered a new problem.\r\n\r\nSome of my opponents did not seem to know that bringing out the queen early was not a good strategy. They impudently conducted a queen raid and won. I understood the rules of development but had not yet learned how to refute the queen raid. I let her majesty roam about the board unpunished, without putting her under attack by my minor pieces. This became my next developmental goal.\r\n\r\nAnother tragicomedy was a game in which the g-pawn attacked my knight and lost the knight and the game. I did not \"see\" that move. Why? I \"knew\" it was not good to move the pawns in front of the king, so why would my opponent do such a thing?\r\n\r\nWhat we see on the Board depends on our understanding of chess. We cannot see everything; chess is too complex. Trying to see everything would result in cognitive overload, which interferes with your ability to process information accurately and often results in blunders.\r\n\r\nWhereas all good chess players use multiple levels of encoding, i.e., piece value, position, and basic general principles such as force, space, time, pawn structure, etc., they assign different priorities to these aspects while encoding. These different priorities result in differences in interpreting the game, manifested in differences in awareness of strengths, weaknesses, and blind spots.\r\n\r\nWhen this game was played, my understanding was limited to the rule, do not move the pawns in front of the king; therefore, any move that varied from that principle was a bad move. This event taught me a critical chess concept, don't look only for good moves; good moves are relative to your understanding of the principles of chess. This principle even applies to chess engines and has taken on a new dimension in the battle between fundamentally different ways of encoding with the emergence of AI-based chess engines. The more multilayered our encoding, the more likely we are to read a position accurately and select the best move.\r\n\r\nThe ability to encode information on multiple levels takes time. It requires careful balancing between students' natural talent, depth of understanding of chess content, and cognitive strengths. The challenge of the chess educator is to help students to acquire these skills in the most effective way possible.\r\n\r\nRenate Otterbach\r\nThis post is part of the<em> Develop learning to learn strategies through chess<\/em> series<em>.<\/em>","Excerpt":"","Date":"2023-01-19 16:32:52","Post Type":"post","Permalink":"https:\/\/edu.fide.com\/how-can-we-maximize-chess-learning\/"},{"ID":"2538","Title":"FIDE School Instructor training course in Lagos, Nigeria","Content":"The on-site training course, led by Anzel Laubscher from the FIDE Chess in Education Commission, was held on January 3rd and 8th.

How does this happen?\r\n\r\nAs opponents discuss their games in the skittles room, we frequently hear comments like \"I didn't see this move coming.\" \"Where did this knight come from? All chess players have blind spots, things they do not see. As William Lombardy once stated to me: \"nobody sees everything.\"\r\n\r\nChess is too complex a game to see everything. Even computers have blind spots; these vary based on the program. Otherwise, no computer would ever beat another computer. All games would be a draw, or the side with the first move would always win because of the extra tempo. However, the blind spots of computers often are so minuscule that, for most humans, they are undetectable.\r\n\r\nHigh-rated players have learned to navigate around their blind spots, thereby minimizing the impact that blind spots have on their game. These players have learned to build on their strengths, often choosing openings designed to steer the game away from their blind spots toward their strengths.\u00a0 <!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Selective encoding\u2014the key to our chess strengths and weaknesses<\/strong>\r\n\r\nJust like we cannot see everything on a chessboard, we cannot encode everything; it would overload our brains. It would be like thousands of cars driving randomly on a vast, paved lot without markings or signs. Chaos would result. Consequently, our bodies have the equivalent of road signs; many are biologically based and function automatically unless a certain threshold is reached.\r\n\r\nFor example, you are unconscious of your breathing until you get a certain level of exertion. At that point, a threshold is reached, and we become aware of our breathing. We must consciously pay attention to our breathing if we want to change our breathing pattern. Many exercise programs are designed to teach us more effective breathing patterns to improve our performance.\r\n\r\nIn chess, as in exercise, what aspects we attend to will be encoded, while the rest will be ignored or forgotten. Thus, what we choose to attend or not attend determines our strengths and weaknesses. The attributes of a position we attend to are encoded, while the parts we do not attend to are ignored. Over time, we correct and build on our prior encoded knowledge base, deepening our understanding of the game. Chess teachers can expedite this process by helping students identify problem areas, discussing tactical patterns, and strategic decision-making.\r\n\r\n<strong>\u00a0<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Causes of variation in chess strengths and weaknesses<\/strong>\r\n\r\nMost people assume that everyone encodes information the same way they do. Consequently, they tend to focus more on those areas they find difficult; this, however, creates a problem because their students may have different encoding preferences. Generally, people are able to adapt to small misalignment of encoding differences, but if the differences go beyond a certain threshold, they have difficulties accurately encoding the information.\r\n\r\nIf, however, there is a large gap between how the materials are presented and the students' encoding preferences, faulty or partial encoding may result. This may be especially true for neurodiverse students who use different methods of encoding, storing, or retrieving information.<a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\">[i]<\/a> Thus, what a person chooses to encode or not encode determines their sensitivity or insensitivity to certain stimuli.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, we store information in our brains differently based on our cognitive strengths and weakness, our preferences, or our cultural\/societal values. These differences in encoding determine what we attend to (and not attend to), in a given position on the board. In short, these differences determine how we define the problem and the solution path we choose to follow.\r\n\r\nOnce we define a solution path, we become blind to alternatives. Our minds shut out other information and focus our mental energy on the chosen problem-solving approach. Over time, problem-solving patterns develop, and we tend to follow these patterns unless they are blocked. For example, an unexpected knight fork can drastically alter our perception. We now have become aware of something to which we were previously blind. Because chess forces us to face our encoding errors, it is an excellent tool to teach effective encoding skills that are transferrable across domains.\r\n\r\n<strong>\u00a0<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Important implications for teaching<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe better the matchup between the encoding system used by the instructor and the encoding system used by the learner so more likely learning occurs. This challenge can be addressed by using different teaching strategies and adapting the curriculum to the various needs of the students. Chess, as a discipline, may be especially attractive to neurodiverse students, as it allows access to information through different cognitive encoding patterns. Furthermore, it has a natural feedback system that enables the learner to reevaluate the encoded information and revise it based on new data.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Major take-away<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWhen we learn something new, it requires a lot of mental energy to encode the information accurately. If, in addition, we must also exert energy to translate one way of encoding (that of the teacher) to another (one natural to us), our cognitive processing system quickly overloads and consequently freezes; this is similar to a computer that freezes. Everything stops, and information is lost or mislearned.\r\n\r\nThus, to help students learn most effectively, it is beneficial to understand the different ways people encode information, the benefits, and liabilities of each method, and how our way of encoding both determines what we recall easily and our blind spots. In chess, we often speak of different types of players; for example, those who focus on tactical advantages and those who are more focused on strategic opportunities; Tal vs. Petrosian. The key to understanding these differences is how they encode the information while studying chess.\r\n\r\nIn the book \"Chess Openings for Black Explained: A Complete Repertoire,\" the authors separate famous chess players into two groups with different encoding preferences. Those with a healthy disrespect for material and those with a healthy respect for the material. Often Tal is called the Magian because of his unexpected sacrifices. One potential reason is that most chess players habitually encode the position based on piece value.\r\n\r\nAn analysis of Tal's games indicates that he may have encoded information based on conceptual components such as time, space advantage, piece activity, etc. Sacking a piece for any of these reasons was not a difficult decision at all. For his opponent, this often created a serious cognitive overload problem because now they had to think totally differently than they were used to. This is supported by the following quote by Botvinnik.\u00a0\" Even when it was not in the spirit of the position, Tal would all aim for open play. He would go in for difficult positions, merely in order to obtain great mobility for his pieces, when his unique ability to calculate variations might tell, as well as... The opponents lack of time for thought.\" (Botvinnik, p. 9.<a href=\"#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref2\">[ii]<\/a>)\r\n\r\nNaturally, to be successful in chess, these players had to learn to encode information both ways and to know, based on the position on the board, which encoded chunks to recall. Encoding materials in multiple ways and purposefully connecting these chunks maximizes learning. This will be discussed in more detail in subsequent blogs.\r\n\r\nRenate Otterbach\r\nThis post is the second part of her<em>\u00a0Develop learning to learn strategies through chess<\/em>\u00a0series<em>.<\/em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\">[i]<\/a> This threshold varies by person. The encoding process of neurodiverse people, such as people with autism, dyslexia, ADHD, and giftedness are normally outside the threshold of neurotypical people. For some people, it may be surprising that giftedness is include in the list. However, Eva Gyarmathy, who has extensively studied neurodiversity includes giftedness. Furthermore, student who are both autistic and gifted, or dyslexic and gifted are labeled twice exceptional. It is also not uncommon to have gifted students who have ADHD. All these factors indicate that there might exists commonality among these differences. Furthermore, none of these students thrive under normal classroom instruction. This will be explored further in a future blog.\r\n<a href=\"#_ednref2\" name=\"_edn2\">[ii]<\/a> Botvinnik \u2013 Return Match for the World Chess Championship Botvinnik -Tal Moscow 1961 (2004) Edition OLMS.","Excerpt":"","Date":"2023-02-17 15:20:12","Post Type":"post","Permalink":"https:\/\/edu.fide.com\/what-is-encoding\/"},{"ID":"2585","Title":"\ud835\udc04\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc14 \ud835\udc02\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27 \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21 \"\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27 \ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1f \ud835\udc13\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc2c\" \ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc1e","Content":"<span class=\"x3nfvp2 x1j61x8r x1fcty0u xdj266r xhhsvwb xat24cr xgzva0m xxymvpz xlup9mm x1kky2od\"><img src=\"https:\/\/static.xx.fbcdn.net\/images\/emoji.php\/v9\/t13\/1.5\/16\/1f4e3.png\" alt=\"\ud83d\udce3\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" \/> <\/span>FIDE and its Chess in Education Commission are pleased to announce the dates of the newly revised Preparation of Teachers course.\r\n\r\n<span data-testid=\"emoji\">\ud83d\udccc<\/span>The course will be held online in English between \ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfd3-\ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfd4 \ud835\udc00\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc25 2023.\r\n\r\n<span data-testid=\"emoji\">\ud83c\udf0d<\/span>The target audience is teachers, chess educators, beginner and advanced players who have a basic knowledge of chess and experience working with children.\r\n\r\n<span data-testid=\"emoji\">\ud83d\udd50<\/span>This brand-new course is focused on chess as an educational tool in the classroom. \u265b\u265a\u265e.\r\n\r\n<span data-testid=\"emoji\">\ud83d\udcdd<\/span>Participants, based upon their exam result, qualify for the \ud835\udc6d\ud835\udc70\ud835\udc6b\ud835\udc6c \ud835\udc95\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc8d\ud835\udc86 \ud835\udc90\ud835\udc87 \ud835\udc7a\ud835\udc84\ud835\udc89\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc8d \ud835\udc70\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc94\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc93\ud835\udc96\ud835\udc84\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc93.\r\n\r\n\u2705Read the detailed course description\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/cloud.fide.com\/s\/kEcf8892NCZpfPm\">here<\/a>.\r\n\r\n\u2705Candidates who wish to attend the course must complete and return the <a href=\"https:\/\/cloud.fide.com\/s\/cBLLjJ8XFAKMnR9\">registration form<\/a>.\r\n\r\n\ud835\udde7\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\uddf0\ud835\ude02\ud835\ude01-\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddf3\ud835\uddf3 \ud835\uddf1\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\uddf3\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddff \ud835\uddee\ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb\ud835\ude00 \ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude00 \ud835\uddd4\ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf9 \ud835\udfed\ud835\udfec.

I have always had a broad range of interests. My first Master\u2019s degree (Master of Divinity) provided a background for theological education and helped me to develop answers to the questions surrounding why we believe what we believe. My second Master\u2019s degree in English helped me to develop my writing skills and fulfil my interest in exploring themes of good and evil in Tolkien\u2019s\u00a0<em>Lord of the Rings<\/em>. This was the thesis paper for my degree.\r\n\r\nI enjoy literature of all kinds, and over the years I have come to understand the power of stories in our lives. I have also always had a passion for helping others to succeed. My current activities in chess arise from first-hand observations of the impact of the game on elementary school students. To have the greatest success in life, people need to make good decisions. I believe chess can help people develop the critical thinking and decision-making skills that are needed to survive and thrive in this world.\r\n<div id=\"cbadsmaindiv_sidebar\" class=\"hidden-xs\">\r\n<p class=\"blog-question\"><em>What have been your leadership experiences? For example, what can you tell us about your activity with the US-based Chess in Schools non-profit organization?<\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clearfix\">I have had a wide variety of leadership opportunities. I started as a classroom teacher. I served as collegiate campus minister and in a number of church leadership roles across a 20-year period. I have been an office administrator for a law firm. In 2005, I was selected as the Scholastic Director for the US Chess Federation. In 2017, I became a full-time National Education Consultant for Chess in Schools, a non-profit organization that focused on training teachers to play chess and use the game to deliver academic and 21st century skills.<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\nChess in Schools (not affiliated with the organization in New York) is soon changing its name to Chess in Education \u2013 US to better reflect our educational mission that goes beyond the K-12 setting. In 2021, Jesper Hall of the European Chess Union\u2019s Education Commission invited me to be the Secretary for the group developing a global survey in partnership with FIDE. After the success of the survey, I was asked to lead the effort to develop a 4-year Strategy Action Plan for FIDE\u2019s Chess in Education Commission. This group included CIE experts from more than 20 countries. Not long after, I became FIDE Senior Adviser for Chess in Education. And in November 2022, I was appointed Chairman of FIDE\u2019s Chess in Education Commission.\r\n<p class=\"blog-question\"><em>Can you summarize your chess career in your country up to the FIDE Chess and Education Commission?<\/em><\/p>\r\nI taught myself how to play chess at the age of 14. I lived in a rural area of West Tennessee and no one else that I knew played chess. My first rated tournament experience was as a college freshman at UT Martin. Fast-forward many years and while I was working as a college campus minister in Lake Charles, Louisiana, I was contacted by the local school board. They asked if I would help them start a chess program in the schools. At that time, in an area of about 100,000 people, there were two of us who could help them. Later, our chess community grew to five adults who could teach chess and run tournaments.\r\n\r\nBut my experience coaching chess to elementary school students became the starting point for training teachers to introduce the game to their students. I saw first-hand how it was helping students to develop critical thinking skills that many of my university students did not possess. My later work as National Chess Education Consultant for Chess in Schools included two significant achievements. The first was a statewide Chess in Education initiative in Alabama sponsored by the state department of education and lasted for three years. Several research articles have been published as a result of the study that accompanied this project. The second achievement was another statewide Chess in Education initiative sponsored by the state Department of Education of New Hampshire.\r\n\r\nThroughout the past 26 years, I have also led professional development (PD) for teachers in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Detroit, Michigan, Washington DC and Tennessee. The consistent feedback from teachers attending the training \u2014 and seeing the results in the classroom \u2014 has been extremely positive. Many teachers over the years have stated that our PDs were the best that they had ever attended in their career as an educator. Since most American teachers must attend multiple PDs every year, I take this as a high compliment not just for the training, but for the reality of chess making a difference in their teaching and in the lives of their students.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I have delivered presentations on the educational connections of chess at numerous local, state and international education conferences as well as at international chess in Education Conferences. It is critical that we help embed the conversation about chess within the educational community to help establish its credibility.\r\n<p class=\"blog-question\"><em>In the exercise of your leadership, what have been the achievements that have given you the greatest satisfaction?<\/em><\/p>\r\nOne of the passions throughout my life has been the drive to help others to be successful. Helping others is a core value for me. I have had the opportunity to do that as a teacher and especially as a campus minister for seventeen years. In the latter role, I counselled university students in making critical life decisions regarding faith, career and relationships. Providing a listening ear to students who often had no one else to go to provided a deep sense of satisfaction.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, creating meaningful professional development (PD) experiences for teachers has given me great pleasure. Most teachers enter that career to make a difference in the lives of students. I love to watch the discovery process take place during a PD as they realize that they can really play chess and use it in their classrooms. They leave the training eager to implement what they have learned. They contact me later about how it has changed their students and themselves as teachers. I am gratified to know that I have helped those teachers achieve their own goal of making a difference.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2606\" src=\"https:\/\/edu.fide.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Jerry2.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" \/>\r\n<p class=\"blog-question\"><em>We are still under the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. In response to the statement that confinement is the greatest psychological experiment in history, what is your opinion?<\/em><\/p>\r\nIt is unfortunate that the latest pandemic occurred during a time of increased social polarization and media disinformation. The lack of trust within society that was already building exacerbated the negative impact both from a medical and psychological perspective. Better critical thinking skills and the ability to discern truth from fiction would have helped. These skills may be crucial when the next pandemic arises.\r\n<p class=\"blog-question\"><em>How do you think the Covid-19 pandemic has affected education, particularly students in primary and secondary schools?<\/em><\/p>\r\nMy wife is a second-grade teacher, so we saw the effects of the pandemic first-hand. The lasting impact has been difficult both for teachers and students. Teachers are now leaving the profession in larger numbers due to the stress imposed by government regulations as well as the increased difficulty in dealing with students who are farther behind in skill development than ever before. Students have suffered significant learning loss through the pandemic period. In addition, many of them find it harder to engage with teachers and other students as a result of the isolation.\r\n\r\nTrying to make up for the lost time in developing knowledge and skills has placed enormous stress on the entire educational system. In the US, it is increasingly difficult to find qualified teachers for all the classrooms. And if a teacher gets sick, it is almost impossible to find a substitute teacher.\r\n<div id=\"cbadsmaindiv_sidebar\" class=\"hidden-xs\">\r\n<p class=\"blog-question\"><em>As a person committed to educational chess, do you think that its entry into the school ecosystem could contribute to the improvement of learning in these children and young people?<\/em><\/p>\r\nChess as an educational tool can be a significant resource for schools. Students are engaged by the game. Engaged students are better prepared to learn. Teachers can use the game in the regular classroom setting to deliver academic and 21st century skills in a short period of time. And time is a significant factor for teachers to deliver quality instruction. Teachers do not have enough instruction time in their day as it is. To suggest that they \u201cadd on\u201d yet another activity is enough to raise their blood pressure. Literally. This is why we stress that chess in education is about delivering the skills that they are already tasked to teach. They can do it faster with longer retention by students. Chess can really positively alter the classroom environment by improving student behaviour and engagement.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s why teachers in New Hampshire this past school year (2021-22) who attended our training were so excited to implement chess in their classrooms. They reported benefits for the school environment and even changed relationships with students. Chess can improve the student-teacher dynamic. So yes, I believe that even in the current stress-filled environment, chess as an educational tool is needed now more than ever.\r\n<p class=\"blog-question\"><em>Tell us about the EDU working team that will accompany you during the period 2022-2026. What are its strengths?<\/em><\/p>\r\nFIDE\u2019s Chess in Education Commission includes 23 leaders from 22 countries. In addition, contributors from these and other countries work together with Commission members in EDU Workgroups such as Research, Universities, Education Awards, Strategy Workshops, Website Development and Content, and Social Media. These leaders bring a wealth of experience, expertise and commitment to the development of chess in education (CIE) globally. They are passionate about CIE because they have seen the skills for students that the game can develop. They bring to this team a variety of perspectives, great ideas for development, and the ability to collaborate in order to accomplish our objectives.\r\n<p class=\"blog-question\"><em>Can you tell us what are the most outstanding ideas and projects for this period? What motivates you?<\/em><\/p>\r\nIt\u2019s hard to narrow this down to just a few! Our workgroups are meeting regularly to develop a variety of great projects for 2023 and beyond. I would have to say that three significant projects currently underway include a new EDU website (along with new websites for the FIDE Journal of Chess in Education website and a research database), revised teachers and leaders courses by the International Advisory Board, and a Development Team to help federations develop sustainable CIE programming.\r\n\r\nWhat motivates me? I am excited to have the opportunity to work with so many people who are passionate about changing the lives of students. When you reach a student, you reach a family. When you reach enough families, you change a community. Reach enough communities and you can change a country. I am motivated by this opportunity to help make a difference in society.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2607\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"830\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2607\" src=\"https:\/\/edu.fide.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Jerry3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"830\" height=\"544\" \/> Liberian students pose with chessboards right after the Chess in Schools program was launched on 18 September 2019[\/caption]\r\n<p class=\"blog-question\"><em>As President of the EDU Commission, what is the mission, vision and purpose of chess in education?<\/em><\/p>\r\nEDU\u2019s Mission is: To make chess an essential tool for educating students around the world. Another way of saying this is that the focus of FIDE\u2019s Chess in Education Commission is to expand the global outreach for chess in education.\r\n\r\nWe see a significant value of CIE for federations that includes a source of significant growth in numbers, access to financial and human resources they may not have had previously. But becoming a partner in education places the federation in a new light. And finally, CIE fulfils the federation\u2019s mission to have a positive impact on society.\r\n\r\nThe role of FIDE EDU includes the following: access key stakeholders, build the CIE community, provide training &amp; resources, encourage &amp; enable CIE-related Research, increase quality professional development opportunities, assist federations &amp; organizations to expand CIE.\r\n\r\nFIDE EDU\u2019s goals for the next four years: position FIDE as the global leader in Chess in Education, double the number of teachers delivering chess-related instruction (from 92,500 to 200,000), double the number of students involved in chess (from 25 to 50 million). The numbers mentioned above are based on the 2021 global survey conducted by the ECU and FIDE. The EDU\u2019s vision for 2023 is threefold: improve communications, expand resources and build sustainable programs.\r\n<p class=\"blog-question\"><em>The management of President Arkady Dvorkovich has given important support to the work of the Chess and Education Commission. What direction do you intend to give to your management? Has Dvorkovich himself given you any suggestions in this regard?<\/em><\/p>\r\nIt is clear that FIDE management is supportive of Chess in Education. They believe in its potential even though they are not professional educators. And they are having more and more conversations with federation and government leaders about establishing CIE initiatives. My goal is to help them become more fluent in the language of CIE so that they can approach those conversations with greater knowledge and confidence. They know it is not enough just to get a leader to say, \u201cchess is good\u201d. There must then be a plan to implement a CIE project.\r\n\r\nSo once FIDE management has those conversations, they can refer them to me to help develop the next steps. And that is why I created the CIE Development Team to help countries construct initiatives that meet the needs of each local context. We must do more than just offer teacher training courses. We must help them build a support structure that assists in maintaining a sustainable program. And we must help them all along the way understand the foundational idea of chess as an educational tool. That is, using chess as the vehicle to deliver academic and 21st century skills.\r\n<p class=\"blog-question\"><em>Most of the world\u2019s most advanced countries have concluded that there are four megatrends: ICTs, biotechnology, nanotechnology and cognitive sciences. From the EDU Commission\u2019s perspective, what links could we make with each of these?<\/em><\/p>\r\nEvery one of these fields demands literacy, math and critical thinking skills. They require familiarity with the scientific method, with problem-solving and collaboration. Teachers can use chess-related activities to make deliberate connections to these skills and more. We just have to show them how. On top of that, new courses are being created that link chess and coding and chess and AI. I believe that educational chess could be a critical part of preparing students for careers in any of these fields.\r\n<div id=\"cbadsmaindiv_sidebar\" class=\"hidden-xs\">\r\n<p class=\"blog-question\"><em>Africa, South East Asia and Latin America are probably the regions most in need of EDU attention. What can the Commission do to contribute to the solution of their problems and limitations?<\/em><\/p>\r\nAs EDU Chairman, I have a commitment to expand CIE globally, especially in those places which need increased attention and support. The first step is to listen. So I have initiated conversations with leaders in Africa, South East Asia and Latin America. Thank goodness we live in an era of Zoom meetings! But in-person conversations and planning are crucial for success. Hopefully those are soon to occur. I need to hear from federation leaders concerning their needs, goals, and overarching vision. I also need to understand what are the specifics of their context that need to be considered in planning a CIE initiative. A one-size-fits-all approach will never work. We must adapt to the local context. In some cases, we need to help leaders understand the concept of chess in education. We may need to personally assist federations in approaching stakeholders and funders. I have already had calls (and in some cases, in-person visits) with leaders from each of these areas. Our dialogue will then help us to decide the best pathway forward.\r\n\r\nThere is another aspect to this. In many countries, some really wonderful CIE work has been happening for quite a while. These efforts need to be brought to the world\u2019s attention. We in the CIE community need to learn from each other. We need to hear the challenges as well as the success stories. So I hope that more and more of these stories can be told on our updated FIDE EDU website.\r\n<p class=\"blog-question\">I recently published a book entitled \u201cChess, cognitive science and education\u201d. There I put forward the hypothesis that knowledge from neuroeducation improves the performance of teachers and instructors in the teaching-learning process of our schoolchildren, not only in academic subjects but also in the study of chess. What is your opinion on this?<\/p>\r\nWe intuitively believe in the power of chess to change the lives of students. And much research focuses on that aspect. But how chess can improve teachers\u2019 instructional skills is an understudied area of research. My focus over the last 20+ years has been on helping teachers to improve their instructional goals by using chess. Consistent feedback from teachers has been that this process has improved their teaching along with the student-teacher relationships. This should make sense, since we advocate that chess can help students with adaptive thinking. It should also help teachers with adaptive classroom responses. Hopefully, additional research in this area will occur.\r\n<p class=\"blog-question\"><em>Who is the most intelligent chess character you have ever dealt with?<\/em><\/p>\r\nI have had the opportunity to meet and\/or become friends with several top chess coaches and players. Over the past few years, I have had the opportunity to become better acquainted with Judit Polgar.

That is why, like all other games, chess has been changing, transforming, evolving through time and the socio-cultural contexts in which it has manifested itself.\r\n\r\nChess is an ancient board game played by two people on a square board with 64 squares (half light and half dark), on which two groups of figures face each other (white and black) and whose objective is to checkmate the opposing king.\r\n\r\nBy its conception, chess is a strategic game in which each player has 16 figures, broken down as follows: a king, a queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights and eight pawns. And by design, it is a sequential game; in which the players alternate their moves one after the other, always starting with white, then black and so on.\r\n\r\nAs a game, chess is a voluntary, disinterested and inconsequential act. Indeed, we must point out that chess fulfils a series of characteristics, typical of games, such as: it is a voluntary activity, it has a determined purpose, it has limits, it stimulates cognitive abilities, it promotes values, it models character, it has a therapeutic function, it has a social function and it evolves.\r\n\r\nPlaying chess is a fun activity that generates pleasure as a consequence of its practice. This implies that it is related to the psychological well-being of the individual, so it tends to reduce the risks of suffering some health problems, both physical and mental, such as states of tension and anxiety.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Chess as a regulated game<\/strong>\r\n\r\nLikewise, and in relation to the internal order of chess itself, it is organised around a series of actions that determine a set of explicit rules, which generates a reality different from the everyday. Thus, the game of chess is governed by laws, rules and norms, and is expressed in a specific time, context and place. While it develops, the player is governed by certain rules that are different from everyday ones. The recognition of the rules contributes to the development of self-control in its practitioners; likewise, respect for the rules and objectives is fundamental for development and social integration.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, one of the most outstanding characteristics of this game, and considering its wide pedagogical applications, is related to the stimulation that this activity exerts on the expression of certain cognitive skills. Important research suggests that the game of chess facilitates the development of soft skills such as imagination, creativity and the ability to plan and solve problems.\r\n\r\nMoreover, being a strategic activity, it promotes the ability to plan and coordinate strategic actions, which in turn stimulates critical, reflective and representative thinking.\r\n\r\nAnother relevant aspect is that chess is a game that stimulates the recognition and appropriation of values for life; an appropriate tool for teaching everyone, but in particular the youngest, values and virtues such as justice, loyalty, self-improvement, coexistence, respect, companionship, etc.\r\n\r\nPrecisely because of its playful nature, based on strict rules, norms and principles, chess has much to contribute to the school because it makes an important contribution to the generation of fundamental values such as teamwork, discipline, tolerance, punctuality and responsibility.\r\n\r\nIn general, in the different games and in chess in particular, there is no discrimination based on race, colour, creed, religion, political inclination, opinion, gender or social status; thus, chess players are taught to respect, recognise and tolerate differences between people.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, and as a consequence of the accessibility of chess and not being age, height, weight or general physical condition decisive, this game can be played by blind people, paraplegics and others with marked physical limitations.\r\n\r\nFinally, in the FIDE Chess and Education Commission, we emphasise that the game of chess stimulates the development of certain cognitive skills and favours symbolic thinking, which facilitates its civilising action by contributing to the integration of the individual into his or her culture. This implies that chess promotes the development and social integration of its practitioners because, as a game, it is a means of interaction of the individual with others, achieving levels of integration that few activities can achieve; with all that this implies in the construction of the individual as a social being.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Source<\/strong>:\r\n\r\nBlanco, U.

It is part of their lives and perhaps one of the few things they can decide for themselves.\r\n\r\nPlay is the most important activity for children's development.\u00a0 Through play, they connect knowledge they have already acquired with new knowledge, thus forming individual learning processes.\r\n\r\nThe term \"play\" designates a generic category of diverse behaviours and constitutes a particular form of interaction of the child with its environment, which is qualitatively different from that of an adult.\r\n\r\nChildren learn from relationships with peers, significant adults and the world around them. Through these interactions they experience a full range of their senses and feelings, how their bodies move through space and how their imagination can create alternative worlds of existence.\r\n\r\nPlay is a necessity, a vital contributor to human equilibrium, it is at once activity, adventure and experience: a means of communication and release in a permissible form, play is a complete educational process, indispensable to the child's physical, intellectual and social development. In this sense, play itself implies a learning process; it is a universal activity and through it, children learn and develop continuously, resulting in healthy and well-balanced individuals through play. Researchers such as Moore, Goltsman and Iacofano (1992), point out that \"Good quality play opportunities have a significant impact on child development\".\r\n\r\nBut play also involves getting to know the environment and relating to the surrounding reality, gradually integrating into it. It is expressing and sharing in actions and then verbalising what is internal.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Play develops capacities<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThrough play, children prepare themselves for future life, to achieve goals, to feel satisfaction, to discharge energies, to get relief from their frustrations, and to generate a fun space for growth.\r\n\r\nThe play component favours the development of skills and personal balance, strengthening attitudes and values, such as respect for one's own rights and those of others, learning to agree, to reach consensus, to know how to wait, to argue instead of fighting. Motor skills will be developed in countless activities and moments of play.\r\n\r\nThus, children benefit from their participation in play; there the creative expression of thoughts, feelings and emotions, as well as physical demands, interact in the dynamic process of play. In this way, play involves the child as a whole.\r\n\r\nIn fact, some research supports the idea that, in the early years of life, play, as an educational medium, is a very important element because it contributes greatly to cognitive, social, emotional and personality development. Through play, children enrich their minds, stimulate their imagination, create situations and find solutions to them.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, many changes have been observed in children's play over the last six decades; changes in form, content, place where it takes place, etc. In most large cities in the West, play has gone from being almost exclusively an outdoor activity to one that is often located indoors in front of televisions, computers, tablets, phones and other devices.\r\n\r\nFor example, teachers have observed that children who play chess tend to show higher self-esteem, suffer less depression and anxiety. The game also acts as a non-pharmacological therapy, effective in reducing stress, sleep disorders, depression, anxiety and other disorders that arise throughout life.\r\n\r\nIn the educational ecosystem, games are very useful because they function as teaching strategies, so the main objective of the game is to increase and stimulate students towards a more creative and fun teaching and learning process.\r\n\r\nGames should be considered as an important activity in the classroom, since they provide a different way of acquiring learning, they provide relaxation and recreation for the student, games allow the participant's interest to be oriented towards the area in which they are involved in the playful activity.\r\n\r\nThe teacher with initiative invents games that are adapted to the interests, needs, expectations, age and pace of learning. For example, games of imitation, hunting and chasing should predominate at this stage. Play brings the joy of movement and symbolic satisfactions and meets the needs of the learners.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Source<\/strong>:\r\n\r\nBlanco, U.

Since neurodiverse students assimilate, store, and retrieve information differently from neurotypical students, they may have problems gaining the same benefits from regular classroom instruction.\r\n\r\nIn a regular classroom setting, when learning new content, they first must decode the instruction and then recode it in a way that makes the content accessible to them. This extra demand for cognitive resources often leads to cognitive overload, diminishing their ability to learn in traditional classroom settings. It is, therefore, not surprising that neurodiverse students are often labeled as learning disabled and or having ADHD. However, when provided with information in a way that is aligned with their encoding system, they often turn out to be outstanding learners.\r\n\r\n<strong>Encoding, Chunking, and Information Retrieval <\/strong>\r\n\r\nHow we encode information determines what information is chunked together and how it is stored in and retrieved from our memories. Over time we become experts in our preferred way of encoding, reducing the energy needed to chunk, store, and retrieve. Chunking is the bundling of information and involves selecting and connecting pieces of information for storage to be recalled later. All chunking consists of the inclusion and exclusion of specific material. Our preferred encoding methods determine how we select what is and is not stored in our memory. Two people may observe the same accident, but their recall may differ based on what aspects were or were not salient to their encoding system. In chess, how we chunk information determines what we see and do not see on the board. Hence, effective chunking reduces chess blindness.\r\n\r\nThe more efficient we are in chunking or bundling information, the more efficient we are in recalling it. This was illustrated by De Groot\u2019s experiment with chess players, who found that expert and higher-rated players could recognize meaningful chess positions more accurately than novices. Still, there was no difference in recall when presented with random positions. Hence, the mental organization of information enabled recall instead of the presence or absence of memory capacity. De Groot\u2019s experiments were the foundation of the theory of chunking, which led to the development of the field of expertise studies and laid the foundation of AI technology.\r\n\r\n<strong>What is effective chunking?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nSimple-defined chunking is a combination of understanding the principles of chess, our natural cognitive strengths, and our encoding preferences. The key to improving the quality of our information chunks is to find effective connectors that link new information to prior information. Regarding cognitive theory, the size of a chunk does not make any difference in information storage. A piece of information, such as a phone number, takes up the same \u201cspace\u201d as a massive block of chunked information. No matter how large, the chunk is counted as one unit; hence, the more efficient a person is in chunking, the more information they can store effectively, regardless of their memory capacity.\r\n\r\nGenerally, logical propositional statements with validated if\u2026 then statements are the best connectors between chunks. In chess, these are often referred to as calculation skills. However, while these connectors allow for superior encoding, they require a high level of mental energy and should be used judiciously, especially during a game.\r\n\r\nAnother effective way of chunking is pattern recognition. Hence learning typical patterns in chess can be very helpful and reduces the cognitive load. The problem with depending too heavily on pattern recognition is that you may misinterpret the position if the patterns do not apply. Many new opening ideas often take advantage of this natural weakness by finding alternative patterns to accomplish the same goal.\r\n\r\nFor example, whereas the traditional way of controlling the center was direct control through pawn placement, a more modern approach is indirect control through fianchettoed bishops. Many tactical strategies also depend on breaking patterns. For example, whereas in most cases, people expect \u201cpiece value\u201d to be the key determining factor of a trade, in sacrifices, often the determining value is \u201cpiece function,\u201d and as Botvinnik pointed out, in the case of Tal, \u201cthe initiative or piece activity.\u201d\r\n\r\n<strong>Implications for Teaching<\/strong>\r\n\r\nTo help students maximize their learning strategies, i.e., to get the most benefit from each hour of instruction, it is essential for teachers to understand how students encode and chunk information and what factors contribute to cognitive overload for the different types of students. Using this framework, they can then identify the best teaching strategy for each type of student.\r\n\r\nOn the surface, this seems daunting; however, chess is an excellent tool to meet this challenge. Because chess requires a combination of cognitive skills to excel at the game, different types of errors may indicate various encoding weaknesses. Using targeted strategies, teachers can help students to identify their strengths and weaknesses and to overcome them through well-designed deliberate practice. As far as I know, no other domain besides chess has this educational potential.\r\n\r\nHow this advantage can be explored further will be discussed in subsequent blogs.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRenate Otterbach\r\nThis post is the third part of her<em>\u00a0Develop learning to learn strategies through chess<\/em>\u00a0series<em>.<\/em>","Excerpt":"","Date":"2023-04-14 14:36:37","Post Type":"post","Permalink":"https:\/\/edu.fide.com\/understanding-the-relationship-between-neurodiversity-encoding-chunking-and-cognitive-overload\/"},{"ID":"2641","Title":"Chess as old as mathematics","Content":"<p style=\"text-align: right;\">by Dr. Uvencio Blanco Hern\u00e1ndez<\/p>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2643 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/edu.fide.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/3.EDU_.MAR_.UB_..jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"283\" height=\"178\" \/>\r\n\r\n<em>\"Mathematics has been essential for advances in philosophy, science and technology. The origin of chess seems to be submerged in the darkness of time, although there is archaeological evidence that allows us to have references to it in the Ancient East\".<\/em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Mathematics and chess; in that order<\/strong>\r\n\r\nMathematics has an origin as old as humanity itself. Records show that, since ancient times, mathematics has been essential to advances in philosophy, science and technology. It has evolved from simple counting, measurement and calculation, through the systematic study of the shapes and motions of physical objects, through the application of abstraction, imagination and logic, to the broad, complex and often abstract discipline we know today.\r\nSome authors argue that, from the bones carved by early man to the mathematical advances stimulated by settled agriculture in the valleys of Mesopotamia and Egypt, as well as the revolutionary developments of ancient Greece and its empire, the history of mathematics is a long and impressive one.\r\nThe East took over, in particular China, India and the medieval Islamic empire, before the focus of mathematical innovation returned to Europe in the late Middle Ages and Renaissance. Then a whole new series of revolutionary developments took place in 17th and 18th century Europe, laying the foundations for the increasing complexity and abstraction of 19th century mathematics, and finally the bold and sometimes devastating discoveries of the 20th century.\r\nOn the other hand, with respect to chess, historians still argue about the date of birth of this ingenuity of the human mind. Some claim that the game is at least 1,500 years old; others double that to 3,000. And although the origin of this game seems to be submerged in the obscurity of time, there is archaeological evidence that allows us to have references to it in the Ancient East.\r\nThis Eastern contribution, similar in some aspects to that given to mathematics during the first millennium of our Era, comes from four different cultural centres: Egyptian, Indian, Arab and Chinese; also dissimilar in value and influence.\r\n\r\n<strong>Chess, mathematics and education are interrelated<\/strong>\r\nAmong the games associated with mathematics and about which there are countless educational experiments. For example, in research entitled \"Your move: The effect of chess on mathematics test scores\" by Michael Rosholm, Mai Bj\u00f8rnskov Mikkelsen, Kamilla Gumede in 2017, these researchers suggest the importance of cognitive and non-cognitive factors in students' academic success. Furthermore, they support the hypothesis that chess introduced into the academic curricula of children and young people in primary and secondary school is important; as chess uses similar approaches and reasoning as mathematics, chess has become a fundamental pedagogical tool in schools and colleges helping students to develop their skills and competences.\r\n\r\nIn the same sense Mart\u00ednez-Artero, R. N., &amp; Checa, A. N. (2015) consider that:\r\n\r\n\"Chess is a game that can be taught to students in the first years of schooling. Hence, future teachers should know some techniques to carry it out and due to the parallelism it has with mathematics, it can be used as a resource in its teaching-learning. The board itself provides support for activities such as counting, placing pentominoes on it, using the movements of the knight, king, rook, bishop and queen\".\r\n\r\nNow, why do we suggest that teachers use chess as a didactic resource in the development of mathematics courses? We make this suggestion based on studies that tell us that chess, being a game, the positioning before it is different due to a greater motivation, greater participation, less tension or stress for learning and for being fun. In this sense, the experience could be placed in a constructivist conception and of a greater interaction throughout the teaching-learning process.\r\nFinally, we must inform that this type of experience focuses on the domain of \"Problem Solving\", although it does touch on aspects such as the introduction and reinforcement of concepts.\r\n\r\nSource:\r\nBlanco, U. 2020. \"Chess cultural heritage of humanity.

It is estimated to have developed from 3000 BC after the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt and lasted for approximately three millennia.\r\n\r\nIts authors explain that due to the growing need to solve everyday problems associated with crops, construction and trade, the Egyptians created their own numbering system; an arithmetic with the four basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) and units of measurement of length, area, volume, weight and time.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian numbering system also made it possible to represent numbers, from one to millions, from the beginning of the use of hieroglyphic writing; they also had the first developed decimal system - base 10 numeration - which, although not a positional system, allowed the use of large numbers and also to describe small quantities in the form of unit fractions: the so-called Eye of Horus fractions.\r\n\r\nArchaeological evidence concerning the knowledge of such methods of calculation comes from inscriptions carved on stones, from calendars and above all from some papyri. Two of the oldest papyri are particularly noteworthy: the Golenischevse papyrus preserved in the city of Moscow and the Rhind or Ahmes papyrus in the British Museum in London.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians reached a high level in arithmetical manipulations but their methods were primitive and without great generalisations; there is almost no symbolism in them because the Egyptians were not given to abstract research.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Egyptians worked mainly in geometry and arithmetic, the Egyptians made great contributions to mathematics because they knew how to calculate the surface, the volume of pyramids, cylinder and sphere, algebra, the solar calendar in astronomy, sundials (gnomes) and water clocks (clepsydras). Because of these contributions their growth was important; so much so that the most prominent Greek mathematicians travelled to Egypt and Babylon to learn from these peoples.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Zero and negative numbers in a culture born in Hindustan<\/strong>\r\n\r\nFor its part, Indian mathematics has made important contributions, as well as a notable influence on Arab mathematics and, through it, on Western mathematics.\r\n\r\nThe oldest extant records from India are the Sulba Sutras (dating from about the 8th century BC to the 2nd century AD), appendices of religious texts with simple rules for constructing altars of various shapes, such as squares, rectangles, parallelograms and others. As with Egypt, the origin of mathematics is associated with religious rituals.\r\n\r\nFor example, in the Sulba Sutras there are methods for constructing circles with approximately the same area as a square, which involves many different approximations of the number \u03c0. Additionally, they obtained the value of the square root of 2 with various approximation figures, lists of Pythagorean terns and the statement of the Pythagorean theorem.\r\n\r\nAll these results are present in Babylonian mathematics, which indicates a strong Mesopotamian influence, although very few mathematical documents have come down to us, despite the high cultural level of this civilisation.\r\n\r\nEven more than in the case of China, there is a tremendous lack of continuity in the Hindu mathematical tradition and, as was the case with earlier civilisations, there is no theoretical formalism of any kind. The main characteristic of mathematical development in this culture is the predominance of the arithmetical rules of calculation, highlighting the correct use of negative numbers and the introduction of zero, even accepting irrational numbers as valid numbers.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, we will conclude by saying that in the history of India there are enough facts that show the existence of political and economic relations with the Greek, Egyptian, Arab and Chinese states. Mathematically, the Indian origin of the decimal numbering system and the rules of calculus is considered indisputable.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Source<\/strong>:\r\n\r\nBlanco, U.

For example: it is a voluntary activity, it has a specific purpose, it has limits, it is regulated, it models character, it stimulates cognitive skills and reinforces values.\r\n\r\n<strong>Voluntary activity<\/strong>\r\n\r\nPlay has emerged universally. It is present in all human beings and therefore in all cultures and in the expression of all normally developing children. In every civilisation and place children play as soon as the opportunity presents itself, doing so in a totally natural and voluntary way. It is part of their lives and perhaps one of the few things they can decide for themselves. In this sense, as a game, chess is a voluntary, disinterested and inconsequential act.\r\n\r\n<strong>Has a determined purpose<\/strong>\r\n\r\nPlaying chess is an act in which the subject enjoys himself and obtains pleasure as a consequence of its practice. This implies that it is related to psychological well-being and therefore tends to reduce the risks of suffering some health problems - both physical and mental - such as states of tension and anxiety.\r\n\r\n<strong>Has limits<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe game of chess is expressed in a specific time, context and place. Moreover, while it is being played, the player is governed by certain rules that are different from everyday ones. Respect for rules and objectives is fundamental for development and social integration.\r\n\r\n<strong>Regulated<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe internal order of chess is organised around a series of actions that determine a set of explicit rules, which generates a reality different from the everyday. At the same time, the recognition of the rules contributes to the development of self-control in its practitioners.\r\n\r\n<strong>Shapes character<\/strong>\r\n\r\nPlay is a factor in the development of the person as it becomes a lifestyle that leads the individual to make it his or her vocation and, in many cases, his or her profession. In this sense, the regular practice of the game of chess stimulates the discipline of its players, who tend to be more organised, structured, punctual, respectful and less likely to fall into bad habits, so that this behaviour can become a factor of personal development.\r\n\r\n<strong>Stimulates cognitive skills<\/strong>\r\n\r\nOne of the most outstanding characteristics of the game of chess and with wide pedagogical applications is related to the stimulation that this activity exerts on the expression of certain cognitive skills. Important research suggests that the game of chess facilitates the development of soft skills such as imagination, creativity and the ability to plan and solve problems.\r\n\r\n<strong>Promotes values<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe game is an appropriate tool to teach values and virtues such as justice, loyalty, self-improvement, coexistence, respect, companionship, teamwork, discipline, responsibility and tolerance to everyone, but particularly to the youngest.\r\n\r\nThe game is a factor in the development of the person as it becomes a lifestyle that leads the individual to make it his or her vocation and, in many cases, his or her profession. In this sense, the regular practice of the game of chess, due to its strong social character, stimulates the discipline of its players, who tend to be more organised, structured, punctual, respectful and less prone to fall into bad habits, so that this behaviour can become a factor of personal development.\r\n\r\n<strong>Has a therapeutic function<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe therapeutic value of chess lies not only in the pleasure of the fun itself, but also in its capacity to function as an element that releases tension and retained energy.\r\n\r\nIt has also been observed that children who play chess tend to show higher self-esteem, suffer less from depression and anxiety. Additionally, this activity contributes to coexistence by forcing the player to work as a team, to collaborate with others and to learn that strength lies in the union of many.\r\n\r\nFinally, the game of chess acts as an effective non-pharmacological therapy to reduce stress, sleep disorders, depression, anxiety and other disorders that arise throughout life.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Source<\/strong>:\r\n\r\nBlanco, U.

Children of all times and places have played, alone or in groups. It is therefore a natural human activity. However, play goes beyond pure fun; it is an engaging, voluntary and spontaneous activity; a way for children to test their limits (what they are, what they can do and how far they can go), to engage in new experiences and to learn about themselves and others.\r\n\r\nAlso noteworthy is the very close relationship between the concepts of play and culture. In fact, Huizinga (1938) stated that play is older than culture; therefore, civilisation arises and develops in play. Corsaro (1985), for his part, points out that the games we play create a common cultural bond that links children with previous generations; but it also creates a cultural bond between the children themselves.\r\n\r\nThe game of chess is an avenue by which virtuous habits and patterns of character facilitate the insertion of its young practitioners into the public sphere of adult life, most particularly in the integration into the world of work. It is therefore an opportunity for the development of character, understood as \"a set of values of moral action\".\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Chess, a game of strategy<\/strong>\r\n\r\nChess is conceptualised as a strategy game, i.e. it belongs to the group that contributes to the development of the ability to concentrate, tactical thinking and will, through decision-making and in the course of complex or uncertain situations. These activities are mainly used in the exercise of thinking strategies, within the heuristic methods that pedagogy defines as \"techniques for learning to learn\".\r\n\r\nFrom the pedagogical point of view, we insist once again that, as a game, chess fulfils a series of characteristics typical of games, namely:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>It assumes a social function<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe game of chess stimulates the development of certain cognitive skills and favours symbolic thinking, which facilitates its civilising action by contributing to the integration of the individual into his or her culture. This implies that this game promotes the development and social integration of its practitioners because, as a game, it is a means of interaction of the individual with others, achieving levels of integration that almost no other activity can achieve, with all that this implies in the construction of the individual as a social being.\r\n\r\nIn the game, and in particular in chess, there are no colours, races, creeds, sexes or social strata, which is why chess players are taught respect, recognition and tolerance for the differences between people.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Chess also evolves<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThere is no human group in which the game does not exist; it has evolved along with such groups throughout history. According to Boyd, R. and Ricerson. P. (2005), \"Culture... consists of the body of ideas, skills, values, beliefs, languages and attitudes that can be acquired through imitation, teaching and other forms of indirect social learning such as social facilitation of attention to particular actions or objects. Culture is information that is transmitted and that conditions the behaviour that individuals develop.\"\r\n\r\nHuizinga (1990), for his part, affirms that play predates any culture and that we have to go back to the first inhabitants of planet Earth; he also points out that \"There has been a factor of playful competition older than culture itself that permeates all life in the manner of a cultural ferment, so we can say that play was an integral part of civilisation in its early stages.\"\r\n\r\nCivilisation arose with play and as play, never to be separated from it again. From its remote origins in Egypt, India, Persia, China or Ireland, chess has accompanied the birth, development and fall of many civilisations, and has survived them, evolving both in its structure and forms, as well as in its rules and universal scope over a period of more than 30 centuries.\r\n\r\n<strong>\u00a0<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Source<\/strong>:\r\n\r\nBlanco, U.

They surround us, put pressure on us and permanently influence our decision making. We are talking about stereotypes. According to Quin &amp; McMahon (1997), a stereotype is:\r\n\r\n\"A conventional image or popular prejudice about different groups of people. In this sense we can find different typologies of stereotypes, for example: gender, nationality, race, class or group stereotypes. Stereotyping is a method of categorising different groups by their appearance, behaviour, customs or gender. Thus, when the most characteristic features of a group are identified, they are used to represent the group as a whole, giving rise to a stereotype classification, which can be good or bad. All these deductions lead us to affirm and establish that behind stereotypes we find different value judgements\".\r\n\r\nThis implies that stereotypes represent generalisations that are embodied by different social groups and that society is therefore exposed to them permanently and with almost no control over them. For the most part, they are \"systematised beliefs, internalised by everyone unconsciously, which conceal different value judgements. In this way, invisible codes are established by which society is suggested how it should behave or what role it should follow, but more importantly, how it should be (Quin &amp; McMahon, 1997). Now, if stereotypes are very simplified and collective mental images or constructions, can they reach athletes? Yes, as we can find in boxing, artistic gymnastics, sumo or chess. In all of them, there are stereotypes that are quite widespread in our society.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>What is the stereotype of chess players in modern society?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWe can. help to raise the intelligence levels of our students and help them to succeed in a wide variety of subjects. Since the end of the 19<sup>th<\/sup> century, public opinion has generally accepted the idea that chess promotes the mental development of its players. That it strengthens basic processes such as perception, attention, memory, etc. But it also stimulates more complex skills such as logical, creative and critical thinking, as well as problem solving and decision making.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>So why does society think that chess can stimulate mental skills?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nIn general, society has long regarded chess as a way for children to increase their mental dexterity, concentration, memory and analytical skills. To anyone who has known the game, it is not surprising that these assumptions have been tested in several studies on how chess can improve students' grades. Furthermore, playing chess is fun; if children associate school and learning with fun, then they are more likely to develop a greater attachment to school.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, research in this field has shown that there are many links that can be made between the game and psychology. In fact, some experts believe that chess is a test of patience, nerves, willpower and concentration. It improves your ability to interact with other people. It tests your sportsmanship in a competitive environment. On the other hand, there is a very strong perception regarding the connection between chess and intelligence. It is a social value, probably initiated around the 16th century. It is unique, enduring and strong. Some authors estimate that society perceives a powerful connection between playing chess and being smart. This can be very positive for young children, who, rather than being bullied as many adults are, embrace the notion. As children get older, a stigma or nerd factor attaches to \"being smart\".\r\n\r\n<strong>\u00a0<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Source<\/strong>:\r\n\r\nBlanco, U.

We also examined the importance of maximizing the relevant information stored in each chunk and minimizing the useless material. This is important because it affects the quality of our recall. Information chucked together is recalled together; it is like taking a box out of storage; whatever is in the box is brought out together.\r\n\r\nWhen playing chess, it is essential to know what part of recalled information is relevant to the position on the board and what is irrelevant. The ability to quickly and accurately identify information pertinent to the position on the board is one characteristic that differentiates a chess expert from a novice. The key is the quality of the chunk recalled. Well-organized chunks make it easier to identify and quickly recall the appropriate information. Thus, effective chunking, making the chunks the right size and logically connecting various chunks to each other is key to effective recall.\r\n\r\nHow does one develop this ability? That depends on several things. In chess, this is easily illustrated through the knowledge of opening theory. The advantage of knowing the opening theory is that you know what moves are likely to occur and how to respond to them; this reduces cognitive load and allows for effective chunking. I know this from personal experience.\r\n\r\nWhen I first started playing chess, I was told that beginners should focus on tactics and other aspects of chess and not on opening theory. I faithfully followed these instructions. As the concept of development was relatively easy for me to understand, I generally came out well from the opening; however, I lost my games to blunders because I had spent too much of my mental energy figuring out various variations in the opening, reducing my ability to think clearly in the middle game.\r\n\r\nCalculation requires a lot of mental energy; hence it is essential to know when to use calculation and when to rely on once general chess knowledge. One of the advantages titled players have over the novice is that they can quickly and accurately identify critical positions and invest their mental energy there. They also use calculation exercises to build their calculation skills, similar to athletes using weights to build muscles. I was like a novice trying to do the workout of a trained athlete, trying to figure out opening theory on my own instead of relying on the knowledge of professionals developed over centuries. Opening theory provides carefully organized chunks vetted over centuries of practice. As a body of knowledge, it provides the foundation for understanding the game.\r\n\r\nOnce I realized that, I started studying opening theory. My blundering decreased, and I won more games. Naturally, I also worked on my tactics and other areas of chess. So how do I know that my study of opening theory made a difference? To answer this question, I analyzed my win\/loss rate by the various openings I played. I found a difference of a 10-20% win-loss rate difference between the openings I had studied deeply and those I had studied less thoroughly or not at all.\r\n\r\nAn important note, when I study openings, I do not memorize them. I try to understand the reason behind the moves and explore alternative options that seem natural but were not played. In other words, I spent some time ensuring that I maximized the quality of my opening chunks, reducing as much misinformation as possible. Ensuring that the information is learned accurately and effectively helps reduce misconceptions.\r\n\r\nIt is important to remember that I started my study of chess as an adult bringing to chess analytic skills developed in other disciplines, most likely reducing the cognitive load of learning opening theory. In teaching students, it is crucial to assess the timing of when to introduce a concept and the level of depth at which it should be introduced. In doing so, it is important to consider individual differences, as what is easy or difficult for any given person varies, as discussed in prior blogs of this series.\r\n\r\n<strong>The problem of misconceptions <\/strong>\r\n\r\nPeople who learn chess without studying it frequently develop bad habits, as pointed out in the book \"Searching for Bobby Fischer.\"<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">[1]<\/a> These bad habits are generally based on misconceptions. Misconceptions are a serious stumbling block to learning. To use an analogy, misconceptions are like driving in the opposite direction from your destination. To get back on the right track, you need to turn around, return to the starting point, and start in the right direction, losing time. Furthermore, unless something alerts you that you are going the wrong way, you will get further and further from your destination.\r\n\r\nThe same is true for misconceptions. The longer they are held, the more difficult they are to correct. Moreover, unless they are recognized, they undermine the learning process because the conceptual framework of a concept is built on a shaky foundation. Hence, the primary responsibility of an effective teacher is to help students to identify their misconceptions and to address these problems. This major teaching challenge is often neglected, resulting in sub-optimal learning, and most likely is also the cause of rating plateaus.\r\n\r\n<strong>How to reduce the development of misconceptions <\/strong>\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to deal with misconceptions. The first is to reduce the probability that they are developed. There are three critical elements in accomplishing this. First, a well-designed curriculum systematically helps students connect important ideas accurately. Second, a flexible teaching approach allows teachers to adapt the curriculum to the students' various skill levels, abilities, and encoding preferences. Third, a continual assessment process enables the teacher to identify possible misconceptions quickly and address them before they become solidified.\r\n\r\n<strong>How to correct misconceptions<\/strong>\r\n\r\nOnce a misconception has occurred, it is essential to identify its source accurately. What is it that the student misunderstood, and why did this misunderstanding occur? Restating information in the same way as it has been stated before most likely will not help. For example, if students have difficulty with tactics, they are encouraged to do tactics, yet this general suggestion may be too broad to address an individual student's need.\r\n\r\nWhen I first started playing chess, I had a problem seeing tactics, and I was encouraged to study tactics, which I did. I spent hours and hours and hours studying tactics with this minimal benefit. Every time I asked for help, the answer was the same, study tactics. I enjoyed studying tactics but was discouraged by the lack of progress. Maybe chess was not for me, but I enjoyed the game, so I decided to persevere.\r\n\r\nNot until I attended a chess camp and GM John Fedorowicz reviewed my games did I get a clue about my real problem. \"You play well, but you don't see long-range bishops.\" He told me. At first, I was startled, \"I don't see long-range bishops? How could I miss them?\" But he was right; I reviewed my games, and I did have a \"long-range bishop blindness.\" This was confirmed in a teaching session when my tutor reviewed my position and told me, \"You had a good position until you lost your rook; why did you not move it when it was attacked?\" \"I did not see the fianchettoed bishop attacking the rock,\" I replied. My tutor was puzzled by the answer. These two incidents gave me an important insight; I realized I see squares, concepts, and patterns first, then pieces.\r\n\r\nThese insights changed my approach to studying chess. First, I identify specific weaknesses and then find target training to address those weaknesses. As mentioned above, one of my weaknesses was seeing pieces. I used targeted \u201cpiece-awareness\u201d tactics training to address this issue. To address the problem of lack of \u201cpiece awareness,\u201d I used a tactics program that provided systematic training for different pieces and matting patterns, using two-piece checkmates after working through a large problem set (about 20,000). Before pinpointing this specific problem area, I had engaged in hrs and hrs of tactics training with slight improvement even with consistent training over extended periods. In the original computer training program, I reached a plateau around 1400 which I could not break.\r\n\r\nAfter my intensive \u201cpiece-awareness\u201d tactics training, \u00a0I returned to the original computer program and again tried to improve my score. Although the problem presented was based on random tactical themes (i.e., not just two-move checkmates with predefined pieces), my tactics score rose 800 points within two to three weeks.\r\n\r\nStill, it was not sustainable because of the limited scope of my exercises. So, I supplemented my \"piece-focused training\" with more complex tactics that are theme-based, such as pins. I had developed a training system that worked for me and now knew what to do. I started systematically to study each theme pins, taking the defender, piece sacrifice, creating passed pawns, etc., first by itself and then tested myself with tactics program that randomly tested these themes. My tactics score improved from 1400 to around 2000-2200 sustainable score. <a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\">[2]<\/a>I still use both tactic studies, two-piece checkmate with predefined pieces for automating mating patterns and piece visualization\/awareness, and theme-based patterns. I discovered some themes were more difficult for me, so I customized my practice accordingly.\r\n\r\nThere is a difference between knowing that the piece in an absolute pin cannot move, seeing the pin on board, and finally knowing how to take advantage of the fact that the piece is pinned.<a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\">[3]<\/a> Tactics training helps us translate concepts such as pins, skewers, etc., from conceptual to practical knowledge.<a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\">[4]<\/a> I primarily use tactics programs with a tactics ELO based on the number of tactics solved and the perceived difficulty level.<a href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\">[5]<\/a> Doing so enables me to track my progress. I keep an Excel sheet that tracks my progress by different tactical themes; this allows me to identify tactical concepts that are difficult for me, helping me to develop my deliberate practice.\r\n\r\nNaturally, chess is more than tactics, so I started focusing on other aspects of the game. Over the past two years, my primary focus has been opening theory. One of the discoveries I made in studying opening theory is that my understanding and enjoyment of the game has drastically increased; I also started to remember to move order, which was impossible; any attempt trying to do so was very frustrating. Changes are occurring, which is encouraging, even if my overall ELO rating has not changed much.\r\n\r\nMy current focus of study is the middle game. An analysis of my games indicates that whereas I generally come out of the opening with an advantageous position, I tend to lose my advantage somewhere in the late middle or early endgame. I enjoy working my way through the different phases of the game and trying to master each phase.\r\n\r\nAlthough, in my case, the origin of the problem was not a misconception per se but rather a lack of spatial perception, the solution path is the same. A clear, specific, and accurate problem identification is the prerequisite for improvement. Once the area of difficulty has been identified, it should be followed by a clarifying explanation (if needed) and deliberate practice. If this process is engaged in persistently, I believe it will also help avoid plateaus or break them, but that is another blog.\r\n\r\nTo provide an example that is a common misconception frequently learned by beginners, I want to conclude this blog with castling as an example. The goal of castling is to bring the king to safety. Often, beginning players pay little attention to their king's safety as they focus on attacking the opponent's king. Often these games are aggressive, open games where bringing the king to safety is of primary importance; hence beginners are advised to castle early in the game. Good advice \u2013 yet the student may focus on the concept of castling early rather than on the concept of bringing the king to safety. This slight misconception may have undesirable consequences; the student may dutifully castle early, right into an attack. Misconceptions based on differences in interpretation are common, no matter how hard we try to communicate accurately. Furthermore, what is challenging for one person may be self-evident for another; hence, there as differences in the challenges that beginning students face in the same educational setting.\r\n\r\nSo far, in this series of blogs, we have focused on cognitive processing skills, which are the foundation of understanding individual strengths and weaknesses and individual differences. In this blog, we touched lightly on the idea of the plateau, a concept that I plan to discuss in subsequent blogs. Yet, for the beginning learner, one of the main struggles often is transfer what they are taught to position on the board during the game.\r\n\r\nIt is like learning a foreign language; just because you know the words does not mean that you can speak the language. Often, context changes the meaning, there are idioms, and frequently in the actual spoken language, the meaning of the words used is different from their dictionary definition. For example, In the US, something can be hot (exciting) or cool (also exciting); in this context, knowing the definition of hot and cold will not help you to understand what is meant. In chess, there is theory, rules, and guidelines, but in the end, it comes down to this \"In this position\u2026\"<a href=\"#_ftn6\" name=\"_ftnref6\">[6]<\/a> what needs to be played. Chess, like life, is a balancing act between the ideal and the real, the principles taught, and the position on the board. This feature is want makes chess such a fascinating game and a lifelong challenge.\r\n\r\nRenate Otterbach\r\nThis post is the fourth part of her<em>\u00a0Develop learning to learn strategies through chess<\/em>\u00a0series<em>.<\/em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<pre><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\">[1]<\/a> Waitzkin, Fred.(1984).

The latter mirrors the ELO system used for chess ratings).\r\n\r\n<a href=\"#_ftnref3\" name=\"_ftn3\">[3]<\/a> Knowing these differences enables us to target our training and making it more time effective.

That is why the first research was directed towards the processes involved in solving chess problems. As a result, they considered that the search for solutions to multiple problems, presented on the board, suggested the performance of a complex cognitive activity. Hence its attraction.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, chess presents a series of characteristics as an experimental technology, proving to be enormously productive in the field of computer science. In this respect, hundreds of academic articles have been written about chess and its applications in artificial intelligence; thousands of chess programs have been developed, most of which are still running, and hundreds of millions of computer chess games have been and are being played every day.\r\n\r\nSo computer chess represents a relatively simple system that can nevertheless be used to explore larger and more complex phenomena. So chess dominates artificial intelligence; thus it occupies a prominent place in the iconography of the discipline, as a quick browse through the book and journal listings of its literature will readily attest.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Intellectual and emotional domains as priority areas<\/strong>\r\n\r\nCognitive psychology, by using chess as a working tool in the exploration of the mind and the skills to be developed, has come up with two major areas of interest; complementary to each other: the intellectual, properly speaking, and the emotional. We have already seen in Blanco (2007) that:\r\n\r\n<em>\"In the intellectual domain the impact of chess education is observed through the modification of the following skills: perception, attention, memory, analysis and synthesis, mathematical logical thinking, critical thinking, problem solving, decision making, emotional control and self-esteem, among others\".<\/em>\r\n\r\nAs for the social aspect, it has also been observed that groups of schoolchildren who study chess regularly tend to: recognise and accept rules, accept and tolerate different ideas and points of view; collaborate with teamwork, accept defeat as an opportunity to learn, recognise silence as a shared right, etc.\r\n\r\nOn this topic, Armenian psychologists Ruben Aghuzumtsyan and Sona Poghosyan have conducted research with schoolchildren in Armenia, in which they explain how the systematic study of chess has a positive impact on the development of several of the most important thinking skills in children and young schoolchildren participating in organised chess courses.\r\n\r\nThe results of this experience are in line with an important body of research showing that, in addition to contributing to cognitive and creative development, chess has an additional impact on children's concentration, will and memory. Naturally, these are essential traits for any school pupil.\r\n\r\nThe authors consider that, going forward, many questions remain to be asked - and answered - in the field of chess education. And they stress that, while current lines of research must maintain their momentum, there is also potential to incorporate medical and neurological approaches. Nevertheless, the introduction of chess into the school curriculum has generated a considerable amount of psychological, sociological and pedagogical research. Its innovative approaches and intriguing discoveries have aroused great interest among collaborators abroad.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em><strong>Source<\/strong><\/em>\r\n\r\n<em>Aghuzumtsyan, R. &amp; Poghosyan, S.

Fair play is manifested by the acceptance without discussion of the referee's decisions, except in sports where the rules authorise an appeal. The will to play to win, the first and essential objective, and the firm refusal to win at any price. Educators and sportsmen and women must understand that fair play is a concept of a strictly sporting nature.\r\n\r\nThe concept of Olympism was born in Greece in 776 B.C. with the creation of the Ancient Olympic Games. Twenty-three centuries later, in the middle of the 19th century, English educators invented \"modern sport\", which soon became so popular throughout the world, the idea that it should be practised in a spirit of loyalty was already implicitly contained in its action.\r\n\r\nThe expression \"fair play\" soon came to be used to define the honesty and integrity of the competition. Since then, all those who have analysed the sporting phenomenon, in <em>particular<\/em> Pierre de Coubertin, founder of the International Olympic Committee, have praised fair play and have closely associated its essential elements with the practice of sport: honour, respect for oneself and for others.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that as early as 1914, Georges Demeny argued that \"the sportsman who has a spirit of sacrifice, follows a straight path and will never commit an act of baseness for which he can be reproached; he is the accomplished gentleman, a sort of modern gentleman who contributes greatly to the prosperity and greatness of his country\".\r\n\r\nIn the Appendix to the Fair Play Manifesto, a text published in 1964 by the International Council of Physical Education and Sport, we read: \"When in the 19th century English educators invented \"modern sport\", which was soon to become so popular throughout the world, the idea that it should be practised in a spirit of loyalty was already implicitly contained in their action. And very soon the expression \"fair play\" came to be used to define the honesty and integrity of the competition.\r\n\r\nSince then, all those who have analysed the sporting phenomenon, notably Pierre de Coubertin, founder of the International Olympic Committee, have praised fair play and have closely associated its essential elements with the practice of sport: honour, respect for oneself and for others.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, as a result of the increasing emphasis on victory, competitive sport has undergone changes in recent years which have seriously affected the very foundation of fair play. 10 April is \"World Fair Play Day\".\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>A strictly sporting concept <\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe concept of fair play is the interpretation of the term fair play, which means \"fair play\", which in turn means \"respect and recognition\" of the technical rules and regulations (written or unwritten), of an ethical and moral nature that underlie them. Moreover, its values are inspired by the Olympic Spirit.\r\n\r\nThe Code of Sports Ethics considers sport as a socio-cultural activity that enriches society and friendship between nations, provided it is practised with loyalty.\r\n\r\nArticle 6 of the Code states that \"fair play\" means much more than simply respecting the rules: it encompasses the concepts of friendship, respect for one's opponent and sportsmanship.\u00a0 It is more than behaviour, it is a way of thinking.\u00a0 The concept extends to the fight against cheating, against the art of cheating without breaking the rules, against doping, physical and verbal violence, inequality of opportunity, excessive commercialisation and corruption.\r\n\r\nThe Code considers sport as a socio-cultural activity that enriches society and friendship between nations, provided it is practised with loyalty. Accordingly, fair play implies modesty in victory, serenity in defeat and generosity sufficient to create warm and lasting human relationships.\r\n\r\nFair play is manifested by:\r\n\r\n- Acceptance without discussion of the referee's decisions, except in sports where the rules authorise an appeal.\r\n\r\n- The will to play to win, the first and essential objective, and the firm refusal to win at any price.\r\n\r\n- Respect for the rules and the spirit of the game.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the concept of fair play is based on the principle of equality. This idea is built on the principle of equality; equality of conditions in competition and, fundamentally, respect for human beings, whatever their role in the act of sporting competition and in the environment in which it takes place and develops.\r\n\r\n<strong>\u00a0<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Source<\/strong>:\r\n\r\n<em>\"Juego limpio contra el dopaje en el deporte\" (Blanco, U. 2004)<\/em>\r\n\r\n<em>\"Dopaje y trampas en el ajedrez\" (Blanco, U.).

Over sixty representatives from twenty African Chess Federations participated, each bringing their expertise to the table. Senior FIDE officials and EDU Commission members were also present. The aim of the workshop was to promote chess as an educational tool. Commission Councillor Mr. Thabano Mothokomedi took care of the organisation.\r\n\r\nEDU Commission Secretary WIM Rita Atkins hosted the workshop, highlighting the vision of educational chess and aiming to make it an essential tool for educating students worldwide. Chess in Education (CIE) has shown to enhance 21<sup>st<\/sup> Century skills, different life skills and emotional intelligence through game-based learning and peer-to-peer interaction. There are notable curriculum links between CIE and key school subjects as well. Differentiating between educational chess and competitive chess, the Secretary pointed out that the ideal CIE program would be inclusive of all students and not just a few who play in chess tournaments. Coping with defeats and analytical thinking would help improve future competencies in the youth worldwide.\r\n\r\nIt is the vision of the EDU Commission to make FIDE the global leader in CIE. The goal is to double the numbers of educators and the number of students involved in CIE in the next three years. The International Advisory Board and the CIE Development team are established within the EDU Commission to drive progress towards this ambitious goal.\r\n\r\nThe next speaker of the workshop, GM Abhijit Kunte, Member of EDU Commission, encouraged all federations to introduce CIE in their countries, stating the importance of formulating strategies that individual countries can target. He moderated a discussion in which participants recognized the need to engage policymakers and ministers to advocate for chess in primary education, and to secure financial support from multinational companies and social entrepreneurs. Providing chess equipment, training educators, establishing chess clubs and coaches in schools to promote competitiveness and active association with media are key points that were discussed.\r\n\r\nThe workshop then unveiled the new Preparation of Teachers course, which was developed by the EDU Commission, with contributions from WIM Anzel Laubscher, Boris Bruhn, Tamara Sargsyan, and Rita Atkins. Boris Bruhn, Member of EDU Commission, introduced the new course. The course aims to equip educators with the necessary skills to teach educational chess effectively through exercises, chess, and chess-like minigames. The target audience is teachers and trainers with some understanding of chess and experience working with children.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-2799 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/edu.fide.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Screenshot-2023-07-14-174023.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"703\" height=\"395\" \/>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Esteban Jaureguizar, Councillor of the EDU Commission explaining the Moments of a chess class<\/em><\/p>\r\nEsteban Jaureguizar, Councillor of the EDU Commission together with Leontxo Garcia, Senior Advisor of the EDU Commission emphasized the potential of chess being a therapeutic and social tool in education. They advocated for engaging governments, influential journalists, and research groups to promote CIE, stressing the need to integrate chess into the curriculum and make it an interdisciplinary tool or a standalone subject.\r\n\r\nAdriana Salazar, Member of EDU Commission, showcased successful examples of teaching mathematics through chess, illustrating its effectiveness in engaging students and enhancing learning outcomes. Dr. Uvencio Blanco, Member of EDU Commission, introduced a collection of books that could be used in a curriculum for a CIE program.\r\n\r\nConcluding the workshop, WGM Dana Reizniece-Ozola, Managing Director of FIDE, repeated and further emphasized the goal of the EDU Commission to double the number of teachers and children engaged in educational chess worldwide. In her opinion the workshop was a testament to the immense potential of CIE. The interest we see globally towards the game is at its peak. With continued efforts and collaboration, chess can truly unlock the potential of young minds across the globe.","Excerpt":"","Date":"2023-07-14 15:52:28","Post Type":"post","Permalink":"https:\/\/edu.fide.com\/first-chess-in-education-strategy-workshop\/"},{"ID":"2805","Title":"Teaching for Transfer (Part 1)","Content":"<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>by Renate Otterbach<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-2804\" src=\"https:\/\/edu.fide.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/transfer_1-5th-blog.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"632\" height=\"506\" \/><\/p>\r\nOne of the challenges chess teachers face is students' ability to apply classroom instruction to actual game performance. In chess, this problem may be greater than in other subject areas; some potential reasons are:\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>Chess is a complex cognitive game.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Chess, like reading, mathematics, research, etc., is a process-based game -- and process-based skills take longer to develop but can be used across domains.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>The gap between what is learned in class and what is required to play the game well is vast.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\nIn this blog, I want to focus on the second and third aspects. The gap between having domain-specific knowledge in chess and being able to play a high-quality game in chess is enormous. Although many people study and play chess throughout life, most of them get stuck at one level, unable to improve despite spending extensive time practicing. Someone once quipped: You have to study a lot even to be a bad chess player.\r\n\r\nSo, what does it take to be good at chess? From a cognitive perspective, the systematic integration of large amounts of information into a holistic logic system allows you to adapt effectively to new situations on the chess board. From a practical viewpoint, this means you need to have a large chess knowledge base, highly developed analytical skills, and the ability to adapt your synthesized knowledge to the problem on the board for every move.\r\n\r\nThe gap between what is taught in class to use in a game is huge; it requires the highest level of transfer. For the beginning player, even \"easier\" levels of transfer, from one tactics problem to the next, can be challenging. I discovered that when I tried to work through L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Polgar's book Chess: 5334 Problems, Combinations and Games.<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">[1]<\/a>\r\n\r\nAfter I had completed the one-move checkmate section and started the two-move checkmate section, I was lost. I did not have enough information to understand the problem, even after I checked the answer.\r\n\r\nBased on my analysis at that time, I did not have enough chess knowledge of tactical patterns to understand the position; neither did I have the necessary visuospatial ability to see the complete picture after seeing the solution. I could not make any progress because I lacked the necessary critical components: chess knowledge and visuospatial reasoning skills.\r\n\r\nLooking deeper into the scenario, we can identify two key components facilitating transfer: domain-specific abilities and cognitive skills. It also provides us with additional insights. The gap between the student's current understanding and the expected new understanding must be small enough to cross. No transfer will occur if the gap is wider than the students can manage with their current resources.\r\n\r\nUsing an analogy, let's say you have a family with children of different ages going for a walk, and they must cross water puddles of different sizes. Each family member is limited by their stride in crossing the puddle without getting wet. The parents can cross a much larger puddle than their two-year-old daughter. So, what do they do? They pick up the child and carry it across the puddle. If the body of water is a small creek instead of a puddle, even the longest stride will be insufficient; spaced steppingstones are needed. The larger the body of water is, the more complex resources are needed to cross it. If the body of water is a river, a bridge (or boat) is needed.\r\n\r\nThe same is valid for transfer; the further the expected point of application, the more support is needed to enable students to be able to transfer what they learned to new situations. As in the example above, there are two distinct differences, individual differences (stride length) and what could be called absolute differences (inability for transfer to occur without outside resources). As teachers, we must be able to adjust our teaching to address both types of problems. If we do not address individual differences, students will be left behind, bored with chess over time, and drop out.\r\n\r\nIf we expect our students to apply what they learn in class to become better chess players, we must find ways to build effective bridges of knowledge that everyone can cross. This greater challenge requires systematically integrating our understanding of chess, cognitive processing, learning, and teaching. Although we have many building blocks for this \"bridge,\" more are needed. In addition, we need to know how to effectively connect and integrate these various knowledge bases before we can build a solid bridge. To build this bridge, we need further research in curriculum design and pedagogy.\r\n\r\nIn the next blog, we will discuss how teachers can systematically identify obstacles that interfere with student's ability to transfer information.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis post is the fifth part of Renate\u2019s<em>\u00a0Develop learning to learn strategies through chess<\/em>\u00a0series<em style=\"font-weight: inherit;\">.<\/em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\">[1]<\/a> <em>Polgar.

We also hosted GM Nigel Short the FIDE Director for Chess Development. The project was a joint effort funded by FIDE, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and the ZCF. We saw the training of 59 people over three days from 11th to the 13th of July 2023. at Joina City in Harare in the recently revised Preparation of Teachers (POT) programme. The programme had good attendance and very well received. We have been receiving continuous glowing reports from participants on the content,approach, and professionalism in the way the programme was delivered.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday the 12th of July 2023 GM Short did a simul to help raise funds for the ground costs. This event was fully subscribed and went a long way to help with our expenses. The event was black tie and we managed to get 25 players to play against GM Short and they all paid US230.00 to do that. We were able to sell an extra 35 tickets to attend at USD70 each. Many of the Under 16 champions were able to attend and play as some of the tickets were bought by our sponsors so that our juniors get an opportunity to play the GM. We had many other up and coming junior players attend and play. We had key government officials, Chairman of the Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) Mr Gerald Mhlotshwa and the Director General of the SRC Ms Eltah Nengomasha, attend. Many key sponsors also attended.\r\n\r\nDuring this period GM Short visited two government schools in some of the least privileged parts of Harare, Chirodzo Primary School and Lord Malvern High School. He conducted lessons to groups of young pupils who were completely enthralled. The whole team accompanied by Mucha Mkanganwi, President ZCF, also visited St Georges and St Johns High Schools. These are at the top end of the spectrum and are financially very privileged schools. They are important schools as they have a lot of say in Zimbabwe and many of our sponsor parents have their children there. In all instances the FIDE EDU and Development agendas were articulated.\r\n\r\nWe then proceeded to Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe. A lot of chess is played there in the schools and many Zimbabwean young champions emerge from this area. We interacted with the provincial ZCF leadership and many of the current and potential funders from the region. Various schools came to a local hotel in Victoria Falls and pupils were addressed by the team and GM Short taught some chess skills for about an hour. The following schools from Victoria Falls and Hwange National Park attended: Happy Hearts Primary, Chinotimba Primary, Baobab Primary, St Bakita Primary, Megawatt Primary, Chamabondo, Jacaranda Montessori, Hwange Primary and Thomas Coulter Primary.\r\nWe also drove into the rural areas of Matebeleland North Province, in Zimbabwe where Victoria Falls is located, and we interacted with them sharing our vision. GM Short gave lessons to the following schools: Lesedi Primary School and Jafuta Foundation (which hosts three rural schools\u2019 extra curriculum activities).\r\n\r\nThe whole visit was a crucial boost to our efforts in Zimbabwe. The training that was availed would not have been accessed by most of the participants as it\u2019s generally too expensive for them to try to go and get. We also got feedback from one participant, Mercy Mushangwe, that the in-person training is far more powerful that the online course. FIDE honoured our efforts by sending such an accomplished team. Moral support of this nature is priceless and gives dignity to our sport in Zimbabwe. We were able to show our young players that they matter and that the best help is there. Our sponsors and other key partners in Government and the private schools were also able to engage with us and committed at a level that they would not have without this trip. GM Short spoke about his dedication to the sport and what it takes to master it. Those talks were always inspiring and eye opening!\r\n\r\nThe next steps include taking stock of the trip to see how we continue to train more teachers. We would also like to see a way to get our own teachers trained to be able to deliver this course. The hunger is palpable for this knowledge. GM Short also started to review our status as a Federation and we shall work together to conclude some of our key documents such as our new constitution. Our Federation\u2019s emphasis is on the young players, sustainable funding, the teachers\/coaches, and the governance of the\r\nsport. This trip is totally aligned with these aspirations. I would like to thank FIDE and the IOC for the support for this program, and funding the delegates in the way that they did. It is not something we take for granted. We look forward to great chess outcomes in the future with such assistance as this. I would also like to thank Mr Nash, GM Short and WIM Laubscher. They were outstanding.\r\nThese professionals were hardworking, committed and warm. They have left an indelible impact on our sport for years to come.","Excerpt":"","Date":"2023-07-26 20:01:54","Post Type":"post","Permalink":"https:\/\/edu.fide.com\/fide-and-zimbabwe-chess-federation-chess-in-education-tour\/"},{"ID":"2840","Title":"The doctrine of fair play","Content":"<p style=\"text-align: right;\">by Dr. Uvencio Blanco Hern\u00e1ndez<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2839\" src=\"https:\/\/edu.fide.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/10.-The-doctrine-of-fair-play.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"318\" height=\"159\" \/><\/p>\r\n<strong>The concept of fair play <\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe notion of fair play is intimately associated with ethical or moral conduct, which is why some authors consider it to be based on the principle that sport is a permanent search for morality that emphasises participation. The philosophy of fair play has certain principles aimed at developing a true competitive spirit, i.e. a spirit of sportsmanship.\r\n\r\nThe philosophy of fair play emphasises some essential elements:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Respect the rules of the game.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Respect the referees and accept their decisions.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Respect the opponent.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Give all participants equal opportunities.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Maintain dignity under all circumstances.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nThe general implications relate to the overall steps that need to be taken to promote the philosophy of fair play. These implications are:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>It emphasises the pursuit of excellence as an important goal in itself.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Suggests behaviours in line with the way you want participants and spectators to behave.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>It encourages participants to respect the rules and spirit of the game.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Actively promotes respect for officials and other competitors.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Invites participation and giving one's best; as being more important than winning or losing.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Believes that all participants should be treated with respect and dignity.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Considers sport to be just one aspect of life.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<strong>Respect as a central element of fair play<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe study of fair play offers us a great opportunity for the teaching and recognition of values at school; in particular, to children and young people in the process of training. In this sense, the European Chess Union (ECU) has adopted the European Code of Fair Play as a means of disseminating the highest values of the sport, among which the following stand out:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Fair competition: in order to enjoy the products of success, for it is not enough to win. Winning must be measured by absolutely fair means, honesty and fair play.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Respect: for every athlete, playing according to the written rules is mandatory and respecting the unwritten rules is a commitment. Fair play requires unconditional respect for opponents, fellow players, referees and fans.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Friendship: rivalry on the field does not exclude friendship. On the contrary, friendship can grow out of noble rivalries.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Team spirit: individuals may be strong on their own, but they are much stronger in a team. Sharing the moment of victory with your team is the ultimate pleasure.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Equality: competing on equal terms is essential in sport. Otherwise, performance cannot be measured properly.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Sport without doping: fair play means no cheating by taking drugs or doping. Anyone who does this ruins the game for everyone else.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Integrity: being honest and having strong moral principles are essential for fair play. Playing sport within a strong ethical framework is vitally important if you want to be a true champion.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Solidarity: It is important to support each other and share feelings, goals and dreams. Mutual support brings mutual success on and off the field.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Tolerance: the willingness to accept behaviour or decisions you may not agree with develops your self-control. Ultimately, that could be the deciding factor in winning or losing.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Excellence: sport engages us in a collective effort to pursue human excellence.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nThese values have been adopted as chess principles in both the Laws of Chess and the Anti-Cheating and Anti-Doping Regulations promulgated by the International Chess Federation (FIDE).\r\n\r\n<strong>International Committee for Fair Play<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThis Code of Fair Play is issued by an institution whose central purpose is the recognition and promotion of the Code of Fair Play. This is the International Fair Play Committee (IFPC). An international non-governmental and non-profit organisation founded in Paris in mid-1973, whose objective is the promotion of fair play or sportsmanship in international competitions.\r\n\r\nAs its statute states, the main objective is to preserve and promote respect for the spirit of fair play and the values it represents, not only in elite sport and sport for all, but also in everyday life, and in particular for written and unwritten rules, respect for the opponent and the rejection of violence and doping.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Source: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Blanco, U.

Mr. Jerry Nash and Ms. Anzel Laubscher arrived in Lagos, Nigeria on Monday 17th July, 2023, and were well received by the NCF team.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">They got straight to work with a courtesy visit to the Lagos State Ministry of Education in the company of the FIDE VP Mr. Lekan Adeyemi, the NCF President DIG Sani Mohammed, rtd., NCF VP Prince Adeyinka Adewole as well as some other members of the NCF board. Mr. Jerry Nash, on behalf of his team, expressed to everyone his excitement at the visit, his first time in Africa and Nigeria. Mr. Nash explained how he has seen chess improve the mental state of kids and how much of an impact chess has on their growth. He hopes this can be replicated in the students here in Africa and that is why he and Anzel has come to train the teachers here on how they can help their students become great chess players and even better students.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The team was welcomed by the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry as well as the directors of various departments under the ministry. The Permanent Secretary showed his appreciation and expressed his great pleasure in the plans FIDE have lined up in order to increase the awareness of chess amongst children in a bid to build a greater future for them. The Ministry is willing to sign a\r\nmemorandum of understanding with FIDE in a bid to help get more instructors involved in the FIDE Chess in Education plans.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The training commenced on Tues. 18th with a total of 36 students in attendance from different schools across Nigeria and ended on Thurs. 20th with the test taken. While the training was going on, NCF had other events planned for the FIDE Chess in Education\r\nCommission which included visits to Sterling Bank, one of the major sponsors of Chess in Nigeria, and has shown their great support for Chess in Education by creating a program within the bank to cater for that. Mr. Nash also paid a visit to Platform Schools, Lagos who won the National School Chess Championship and will be representing Nigeria at the World School Chess Championship in\r\nKazakhstan in August.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We wish to express our deepest gratitude to Mr. Jerry Nash, Ms. Anzel Laubscher and all the members of the FIDE Chess in Education Commission for their great efforts and contributions in making this trip possible, and for providing the training materials. The importance of this trip cannot be overemphasized, as this has gone a long way in improving the relationship NCF has with the Ministry of Education and by implication the Lagos State Government. The next plans we intend to implement is to get this opportunity across other states in the country, and with the signing of the proposed MoU with Lagos State, we\u2019re certain all other states will be excited at this idea and will be willing to also have this program included in their syllabuses.\r\nOn a final note, we wish to specially thank FIDE and the IOC for their support!<\/p>","Excerpt":"","Date":"2023-08-05 11:13:41","Post Type":"post","Permalink":"https:\/\/edu.fide.com\/fide-chess-in-education-teams-visit-to-nigeria\/"},{"ID":"2856","Title":"Latin America and its need for chess projects as an expression of educational innovation - Part 1","Content":"<p style=\"text-align: right;\">by Dr. Uvencio Blanco Hern\u00e1ndez<\/p>\r\n<strong>Latin America, more than 650 million inhabitants<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe term Latin America (Latin America) has not yet been in existence for a century and a half. It refers to an ethnic and geographical construct that unites a region of the American continent through languages derived from Latin such as Spanish, Portuguese and French. This implies a register of more than 650 million inhabitants, distributed among 28 countries, which in turn total a surface area of slightly more than 20 million square kilometres.\r\n\r\nIn terms of educational levels, there are significant differences and gaps (such as literacy levels), which have not yet been narrowed in favour of greater participation in education. It is worth noting that even with the internal manifestations in terms of the demand for better opportunities and higher quality education, Chile remains the Latin American benchmark in terms of the quality of its education system.\r\n\r\nAlthough primary education is compulsory in all members of this sub-region, it is important to point out that most of its education systems have been trying out innovative educational projects that aim to optimise this process in the different member countries. Many of them also aspire to achieve better results in the PISA tests, in which they have traditionally been lagging behind in relation to the countries of Central and Northern Europe.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-2855\" src=\"https:\/\/edu.fide.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/11.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"502\" height=\"502\" \/><\/p>\r\n<strong>What do we mean by educational innovation?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWe will now present three definitions provided by R\u00edos-Cabrera, P., and Ruiz-Bol\u00edvar, C. (2020), which represent different approaches to this concept, as indicated below:\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>UNESCO (2014) understands educational innovation as \"a deliberate and planned act of problem solving, which aims to achieve higher quality in student learning, overcoming the traditional paradigm. It implies transcending academicist knowledge and moving from passive student learning to a conception where learning is interaction and is constructed among all\" (p. 3).<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Gros and Lara (2009) define innovation as \"the process of creating new knowledge, products and processes, which is an essential part of the work of organisations as it is an essential value for the society of the 21st century\" (p. 225).<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Carbonell (2002) understands educational innovation as: \"(a) set of ideas, processes and strategies, more or less systematised, by means of which it is attempted to introduce and provoke changes in current educational practices\" (pp. 11-12).<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<strong>Chess in the Latin American context<\/strong>\r\n\r\nIn Latin America, primary education is compulsory in all its members, so it is important to point out that most of its educational systems have been trying out innovation projects aimed at optimising this process in the different member countries, one of them being chess in schools. In relation to chess as a sport, all Latin American countries have chess organised around chess federations and associations which, in turn, are affiliated to the International Chess Federation. In addition, and in relation to chess, all Latin American countries have chess organised around chess federations and associations which are affiliated to the International Chess Federation.\r\n\r\nIt is in this context that the International Chess Federation's Chess and Education Commission (EDU) has been encouraging the different governments and their Ministries of Education to implement school chess projects in their different educational systems, with priority given to pre-school and primary education.\r\n\r\nThese proposals are aimed at the massification and dissemination of the laws, principles and rules of the game of chess, aimed at children and adolescents at the pre-school and elementary school levels in the different provinces of affiliated federations. For example, through the study and systematic practice of chess, the aim is to support the application of the development of thinking, as a fundamental cross-cutting axis of contemporary education. In this sense, it is pertinent to highlight that in the work Why chess in schools? (Blanco, U. 1998), the author states:\r\n\r\n\"The educational role of chess lies in the fact that it trains pupils within a framework of rules and meanings, disciplining thought, contributing to the development of character and virtuous action .... Chess, as a discipline that generates values and attitudes, with a long historical trajectory and universal distribution, should be considered a cultural right and therefore the heritage of humanity\".\r\n\r\nTo be continued ...\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","Excerpt":"","Date":"2023-08-07 13:58:17","Post Type":"post","Permalink":"https:\/\/edu.fide.com\/latin-america-and-its-need-for-chess-projects-as-an-expression-of-educational-innovation-part-1\/"}]
